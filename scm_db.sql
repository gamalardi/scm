Honestly, we didn&#8217;t do anything horrible, we simply used direct functions rather than letting WordPress run the same functions. So, we decided to make the plunge. We shifted all file input/output to the WP Filesystem and made the changes to our Redux_Filesystem proxy class to handle our problem cases. We also removed a few URLs here, and some function names there.</p>\n<p>We also embedded some really useful custom Theme-Check checks to further assist developers in submitting their themes to marketplaces. We want you &#8211; as developers &#8211; to know exactly what you need to do to comply. We also added a custom WP.org check, to further help WP.org theme developers.</p>\n<p>Our next step is to add proper escaping to our field HTML output. Though Redux already escapes properly &#8211; since we use the WordPress settings API &#8211; we wanted to ensure you don&#8217;t have to tell your reviewers anything. We don&#8217;t want our code to be the cause of your work being flagged by marketplace reviewers. If we already escape something, we&#8217;ll add an inline comment so reviewers know what we are doing.</p>\n<p>In the end, we seek to comply. We want to ensure Redux is for for the masses and ready for any marketplace (no matter how specific the rules may be).</p>\n<h3>We Need Your Help!</h3>\n<p>Please test the <a href="http://github.com/ReduxFramework/redux-framework" target="_blank">development build</a> of Redux Framework in your own theme. Try out Theme-Check, and make sure we didn’t break anything. The sooner we have more eyes on these improvements, the sooner we’ll be able to make an official release, and the sooner we can push down some of our customizer fixes.   <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>\n<p>As always, a special thank you our developers.

specific settings for the SASS compiler.  Consider the following:</p>\n<div id="wpshdo_1" class="wp-synhighlighter-outer"><div id="wpshdt_1" class="wp-synhighlighter-expanded"><table border="0"

defaults set in the Redux core, and argument you could (but don&#8217;t need to) add to the arguments array in your Redux configuration file (within the setArguments() function).</p>\n<p>The enabled argument enabled or disables the SASS compiler.  We at Team Redux enjoy giving our devs the option to enable or disable features as desired.  Setting this argument to false will disable the SASS compiler.  All CSS will then be enqueued separately, just as we&#8217;ve done for so long before adding the SASS compiler option.</p>\n<p>The page_output determines where the SASS compiler output is place.  By default, this option is set to false.  This mean all CSS output is placed into a singular file and placed in the WordPress upload folder.  Setting this argument to true will output the SASS compiled CSS directly into the page itself, in a style tag.</p>\n<p>We here as Team Redux hope you enjoy the new benefits of the SASS compiler in our ever evolving options framework.  Please feel free to leave your comments

then you should make your own folder under <code>/wp-content</code>, not under <code>/wp-content/uploads</code>. The uploads directory should be used strictly for media files and downloads and other things uploaded through the various wp_upload functions.” <a href="http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/124900/using-wp-filesystem-in-plugins" target="_blank">http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/124900/using-wp-filesystem-in-plugins</a></p>\n<p>Believing his advice to be sound, we followed his suggestion. It caused more misery to devs than not. The lingering issue is simple, too many users install WordPress incorrectly. Often the ONLY directory that is writable is <code>/uploads/</code>. Combined that with the file owner of WordPress and the theme/plugin directories often being different, and the 3.3.0 changes have been a disaster in the making.</p>\n<p>As the Redux 3.3.0 code base spread out to our devs, and consequently their users, we received TONS of issues. We’ve worked to resolve each of them, but the fact remains that Otto&#8217;s advice is flawed, and users don’t know how to fix the problems is causes.</p>\n<p>We implemented this great new filesystem code believing it was the correct way to handle local storage, but it will never be used again. We’re writing to our proprietary directory the uploads directory from here on out.</p>\n<p>If anyone wishes to contribute code that works with Otto&#8217;s model, that actually works we would consider switching back. But for now, we choose function over opinion. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="😛" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"https://reduxframework.com/2014/07/sometimes-standards-dont-always-work/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"4";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:42:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"Reduce Your Panel Load Time by 80%";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"https://reduxframework.com/2014/06/load-time-reduced-by-80/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"https://reduxframework.com/2014/06/load-time-reduced-by-80/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 12 Jun 2014 01:08:22 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Newswire";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://reduxframework.com/?p=1261";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:127:"Okay, so it&#8217;s only been a few days since our last release, and already we have another.

Redux since we launched the <a title="Redux Generator" href="http://build.reduxframework.com" target="_blank">Redux Builder</a>.</span></p>\n<p class="p1">In early March, I conceived the idea to design a site that would auto-generate a Redux<br />\nbuild.  Actually, I wanted to build a fully-fledged panel builder like Option Tree, but with the sheer amount of options available with Redux, the time required would be intense&#8230;and then some.  Instead, I considered building a boilerplate generator for themes.  And what better theme than the ever powerful <a title="_s" href="http://underscores.me" target="_blank">_s</a> by <a title="Automattic" href="http://automattic.com/" target="_blank">Automattic</a>?  I found their generator code and went to town, including a TGM integration, and a slew of Redux arguments.</p>\n<p class="p1">Today, I am extremely pleased to announce we took the project it a step further.  We organized the arguments, gave descriptions, and links for each to our docs site.  We also made it so one could easily export to an admin folder instead of a theme.  This comes in handy for use in existing products and/or plugins.  Lastly, we&#8217;ve now made every Redux field completely independent.  As a result, you can generate a custom build of Redux Framework with your export!</p>\n<p class="p1"> Yes, you read that correctly!  You can make a custom Redux Framework build!  Since one of the biggest complaints about Redux has been its size, weighing in at 6mb for all (34+) fields, the Framework tends to be quite heavy.  Now, that&#8217;s a thing of the past.</p>\n<p class="p1">We’re really excited about the new version of the Redux Builder.  Major props to team member @kprovance for making Redux fields completely modular.</p>\n<p>If you haven’t tried the builder, you SHOULD.  It’s free.  It will save you time.  Oh, and it’s so very choice.</p>\n<h3 class="p1" style="text-align: center"><a title="Redux Generator" href="http://build.reduxframework.com" target="_blank">http://build.reduxframework.com</a></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class="p1">Just a gentle reminder, Redux lives by donations and our extensions.  So if you like the generator, please consider donating a small amount to the project.  You support us, and we&#8217;ll keep making cool things.</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:54:"https://reduxframework.com/2014/05/redux-builder/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2:"20";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:45:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:27:"February

As we began the process of writing out the basic structure for the webinar, we had no idea what we were in for. We didn&#8217;t know how many people would show up or even if our users wanted to hear what we had to say. Thankfully, not only did a shocking number of people show up, but the webinar lasted an incredible two full hours!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Beyond the knowledge we hoped to impart to our users, we learned a very important lesson through the webinar as well. We learned that our users <em>want</em> to communicate with us, above and beyond the communication made possible by our Github issue tracker. As such, we have made a decision. Going forward, we will be holding a monthly webinar to give you a view into our world, and us a view into yours! Beyond that, we will be making steps towards a more active blog, and we&#8217;ve got a few other surprises in store for you as well!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Not everyone managed to make it to the webinar&#8230; but that&#8217;s alright, we still love you! Want to see what you&#8217;ve missed? Great! We&#8217;d love to show you! As such, we&#8217;ve made the entire webinar available on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymMpeBaaLXI" target="_blank">YouTube</a>! Want a copy of the presentation itself? That&#8217;s <a href="http://reduxframework.com/?ddownload=498">available too</a>!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Originally, we had intended this post to include a complete list of the questions asked during the webinar Q&#038;A session.

You can even embed <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/30/feature-plugin-merge-proposal-oembed/">previews of posts</a> from other WordPress sites by pasting the URL on its own line.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There have been a lot of changes for developers to play with as well:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>REST API (phase 1) </strong>— The underlying infrastructure of the WordPress REST API <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/">plugin</a> has been <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/21/wp-rest-api-merge-proposal/">included in WordPress 4.4</a>.

If you&#8217;ve already been using a plugin to implement term metadata, you should read <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/22/preparing-your-plugins-and-your-client-sites-for-termmeta/">this post</a> on how to prepare. Also, the underlying <code>WP_Term</code> class improves caching when working with terms. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14162">#14162</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>Improved <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> output</strong> — <code>wp_title()</code> is now deprecated; WordPress can <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/20/document-title-in-4-4/">handle the rendering</a> of the document title automatically.</li>\n<li><strong>Comments </strong>— Comment queries are now split for performance.

While this is great for users, some companies, plugin, and theme developers are struggling to keep up.</p>\n<p>We recently received the following email from a reader concerned with WordPress&#8217; release strategy:</p>\n<blockquote><p>As the pace of WordPress releases grows, plugin and theme developers have to constantly update their products. This is leading to a real and growing problem among WordPress site owners and companies like mine that handle website maintenance and updating.</p>\n<p>This pace is leading to an almost daily need to fix problems, caused by these updates. Plugin updates tend to break things, even though we primarily use professional, paid plugins for the idea of support and generally better quality products.</p>\n<p>I get that it&#8217;s important to patch security issues, but we&#8217;re also seeing a lot of new functionality, moving plugins into core, and other changes. These cause theme developers to push out updates with great frequency and they make mistakes.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m worried that the pace of core updates is driving the larger ecosystem toward failure. Everyone is scrambling to keep things patched, then new conflicts arise and things break down. The person on the end &#8216;companies maintaining their sites, responsibly, or services like mine&#8217; face a constant flow of updates, then testing, then trying to fix things that have broken.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg, Co-founder of the WordPress open source software project, specifically addressed this issue during the Q&amp;A session of the 2015 State of the Word at WordCamp US. Mika Epstein, who voluntarily reviews and approves plugins for the WordPress plugin directory, voiced the concerns shared by developers who are struggling to keep up.</p>\n<p>With the myriad of technologies developers have to learn, including the REST API and JavaScript, Epstein asked Mullenweg if WordPress is moving too fast and if the number of releases per year should decrease by one.</p>\n<p><span class="embed-youtube"></span></p>\n<p>Mullenweg answered the question by saying improvements can be made to the plugin directory so that users can share the burden in the testing process. He also said that the speed of WordPress development will increase instead of decrease. Meanwhile, the development team will continue to release three major versions per year.</p>\n<p>He then describes a future where developers may be able to lessen their support burden by using the REST API that&#8217;s slated for WordPress 4.5. He also cites how large webhosting companies, such as Bluehost, have automatically upgraded most of the WordPress sites on their network to the latest stable version. Mullenweg ends his response by apologizing to those who feel WordPress is moving too fast but says its worked so far.</p>\n<h2>How Do You Keep Up With WordPress?</h2>\n<p>While we do a great job of keeping users and developers informed, plugin and theme authors should subscribe to the <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/plugins/">Make Plugins</a> and <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/themes/">Make Themes</a> sites respectively. Anyone involved with maintaining WordPress sites should subscribe to the <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/">Make Core</a> site where important information related to core is published.</p>\n<p>We know that the release strategy isn&#8217;t going to change so whether you&#8217;re a developer or someone in charge of maintaining sites, how are you keeping up with WordPress?</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 19 Jan 2016 23:45:17 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"WPTavern: JoomlaDay Florida Invites WordPress Developers to Attend";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=50546";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:76:"http://wptavern.com/joomladay-florida-invites-wordpress-developers-to-attend";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3129:"<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/joomla-day-florida.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50771"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/joomla-day-florida.png?resize=1025%2C474" alt="joomla-day-florida" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50771" /></a></p>\n<p>Last year Jenny Wong and Aaron Jorbin challenged the WordPress community to <a href="http://wptavern.com/venturing-outside-the-bubble-wordpress-community-members-attend-php-uk-2015-conference" target="_blank">venture outside the WordPress bubble</a> after speaking at PHP UK 2015.

In June 2015, Andrew Nacin began the work of transforming GlotPress into a plugin with a <a href="https://github.com/GlotPress/GlotPress-WP/commit/d9d47271c6ce0c8e3d927088853ac47c1d100561" target="_blank">first pass</a> that switched it from using the BackPress external to a WordPress install. Dominik Schilling led the development on GitHub, which included <a href="https://github.com/GlotPress/GlotPress-WP/compare/d9d47271...d0a12dc035" target="_blank">352 commits</a> and fixes for <a href="https://github.com/GlotPress/GlotPress-WP/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=milestone%3A1.0+is%3Aissue" target="_blank">70 issues</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For the first version the goal was to change as little as possible to get it working well,&#8221; Schilling said in the release announcement. &#8220;But still we had to remove some things in favor of WordPress&#8217; API system.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Version 1.0 includes the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It’s a plugin!</li>\n<li>WP-CLI support</li>\n<li>Integrated with WordPress’ user system</li>\n<li>Easy installation through the WordPress.org plugin directory</li>\n<li>Multisite support</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have a customized GlotPress install and you want to switch to the new WordPress plugin, you will want to review the plugin&#8217;s wiki to take stock of the <a href="https://github.com/GlotPress/GlotPress-WP/wiki/1.1-Breaking-Changes" target="_blank">breaking changes</a>. Contributors have also written a guide to <a href="https://github.com/deliciousbrains/GlotPress/wiki/1.2-Converting-Plugins" target="_blank">converting plugins</a> for the standalone version to use the WordPress plugin infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Having GlotPress available as a plugin makes it much easier to use and update. The standalone version had a more complicated installation and configuration process, but it was worth it for the collaboration capabilities that it offered. All this can now be added to any WordPress site with the click of a button.</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/glotpress/" target="_blank">GlotPress plugin</a> is now available for download on WordPress.org and includes a beautiful newly designed plugin icon and banner. An <a href="https://github.com/GlotPress/GlotPress-WP/wiki/2.-Branding-and-Logos" target="_blank">official branding guide</a> is also available thanks to Hugo Baeta and other contributors.

Last week, project maintainers <a href="http://wptavern.com/open-source-project-maintainers-confront-github-with-open-letter-on-issue-management" target="_blank">published a letter called &#8220;Dear GitHub&#8221;</a> that outlines their concerns and the solutions they hope to see implemented.</p>\n<p>GitHub has not officially responded to these concerns, apart from a new Director of Community dropping <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10905338" target="_blank">a note on Hacker News</a> to recognize the feedback with a disclaimer that he is &#8220;still figuring out how GitHub fits together as an organization but&#8230; happy to take a look into these issues and ensure they are considered in how future work is planned.&#8221;</p>\n<p>GitLab, on the other hand, wasted no time in addressing the group&#8217;s concerns in a <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/2016/01/15/making-gitlab-better-for-large-open-source-projects/" target="_blank">post</a> that begins, &#8220;Dear open source maintainers:&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p>We want GitLab to be the best place for any software project, whether open source or not, whether big or small.</p>\n<p><a href="https://github.com/dear-github/dear-github" target="_blank">The letter of GitHub’s open source community</a> is clearly not addressed to us, but we’re thinking a lot about the issues that were mentioned in it. We see many of these things happening and have been working on them for a long time, not in the least because we develop on <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues" target="_blank">a busy public issue tracker</a> ourselves.</p></blockquote>\n<p>GitLab, which already allows project maintainers to <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/blob/master/doc/customization/issue_and_merge_request_template.md" target="_blank">set a template for an issue and for merge requests</a>, is planning on adding <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/101" target="_blank">multiple templates</a>, and is strongly considering the suggestion of <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/8988" target="_blank">custom fields</a>. A new <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/9088" target="_blank">issue</a> has been created to track discussion and progress on the possibility of using a new_issue.md file for templates.</p>\n<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Jobvo" target="_blank">Job van der Voort</a>, VP of Product at GitLab, addressed every concern mentioned in the open letter to GitHub. He highlighted the fact that<br />\nGitLab already has a voting system that transforms +1s into votes and noted plans for improving the placement of CONTRIBUTING.md at the top of issues screens.</p>\n<p>Van der Voort also created a new issue for the GitLab Community Edition called &#8220;<a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/8938" target="_blank">Making GitLab the best place for big open source projects</a>.&#8221; This issue is now home to a long list of of frustrations and suggestions that were included in the original letter to GitHub. Van der Voort and contributors have responded to every single point and have created new issues for improving GitLab where necessary.</p>\n<p>After just four days, the <a href="https://github.com/dear-github/" target="_blank">Dear GitHub</a> letter has received more than 1,100 signatures from open source project maintainers. Although the authors have received no official response from GitHub, the letter has sparked some healthy discussions around the web about how code hosting services can better serve their open source communities.</p>\n<p>Both GitHub and GitLab have built their reputations and business on supporting open source software, <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/08/github-data-shows-changing-software-landscape/" target="_blank">which has now become mainstream</a> and more easily adopted by enterprises. Open source software runs the world. No code hosting site that aims to be the leader can afford to ignore the requests of open source project maintainers for long.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 19 Jan 2016 05:34:16 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:81:"WPTavern: Atom Editor Package Adds Autocomplete for WordPress Actions and Filters";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=50670";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:91:"http://wptavern.com/atom-editor-package-adds-autocomplete-for-wordpress-actions-and-filters";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2759:"<p>Nearly two years ago, <a href="https://github.com/blog/1831-atom-free-and-open-source-for-everyone" target="_blank">GitHub open sourced Atom</a>, its new JavaScript-powered text editor.

All of our WordPress content is on a separate database server, so the main content is still intact. I&#8217;ve also been able to extract a <em>few</em> things from a raw image of the damaged drive.  But there were some things (site-specific plugins, child-themes, media content, utility scripts, my email archives) which are likely gone for good, or that will at least be painful to put back into place (uploaded images, etc.).</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s not much use crying over spilt milk, though, so I at least saw this as an opportunity to freshen up and improve upon my previous server configuration. In its previous incarnation, I had been running Apache workers, and PHP-FPM (PHP 5.6.x). But I also had some web experiments in Nodejs, which I had to run on a non-standard port, so as to not conflict with Apache. Since I was starting from scratch anyways, I&#8217;ve decided to put HAProxy in front of everything, so that I can internally run multiple web servers, and just proxy to them transparently. And while I was at it, I&#8217;ve been hearing a lot of good things about the speed improvements in PHP 7, so I figured I&#8217;d upgrade that, as well.</p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t go into the nitty-gritty details of my install (especially since I&#8217;m not finished yet), but I did want to let others know about a problem I&#8217;ve run into: There is a new development build of the php-ssh2 extension for PHP 7, but it is not quite complete yet. Many things do work, but unfortunately, all of the functions which rely on the ability to use the <code>stat()</code> call are broken at this time. This includes other file-checking functions such as <code>is_dir()</code>, and <code>is_file()</code>, <code>file_exists()</code>. In WordPress, if you are using the SSH2 filesystem class (rather than FTP or FTPS), this will prevent you from using the built-in plugin and theme installers, or any of the automatic upgrade functionality.</p>\n<p>After digging around in the php-ssh2 extension source code for a while and comparing to a previous version, I was unable to find the problem myself. My C programming is too rusty, and I just don&#8217;t have the time to start learning PHP and libssh2 internals from scratch. But, I did <a href="https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=71376">file a bug on the PHP Bugtracker</a>, and the author of the PHP 7 port of the php-ssh2 extension has said that he is working on a fix. So keep an out out for an update on that.</p>\n<p>Just as a side-note, using fstat() on a filehandle opened on an ssh2.sftp file resource, or using the ssh2_sftp_stat() call do work. But that doesn&#8217;t help with the is_dir() and is_file() calls which are failing in the class-wp-filesystem-ssh2.php code. Those functions rely on the PHP internal ssh2.sftp stream wrappers.</p>\n<p>Postscript: I know plenty of people will say, &#8220;You should have had backups!&#8221; or even, &#8220;Your VPS host must suck for not having backups!&#8221;. The former is absolutely true &#8212; I should have done better at backing up some of the things that I did not have backups for. The VPS host is not really to blame. I had gotten a disk size upgrade, and I actually had an opportunity to request a snapshot of my system before I ran the upgrade process to extend my disk. But because I had run it successfully on another server without incident, I got careless. And after the upgrade, the system seemed to run fine for about three weeks before any problems surfaced.</p>\n<p>Original Article: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2016/01/18/wordpress-php7-and-updates-via-php-ssh2/">WordPress, PHP7, and Updates via php-ssh2</a><br />\n<a rel="nofollow" href="http://dougal.gunters.org">Dougal Campbell&#039;s geek ramblings - WordPress, web development, and world domination.</a></p>\n<div class="yarpp-related-rss yarpp-related-none">\n<img src="http://yarpp.org/pixels/5db43ee24c4f1e1d0e45d08cc91b0130" alt="YARPP" />\n</div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 18 Jan 2016 18:14:11 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Dougal Campbell";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:90:"WPTavern: WPShout’s 2016 Webhosting Survey Results Show Specialized Hosts Are Doing Well";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=50665";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:97:"http://wptavern.com/wpshouts-2016-webhosting-survey-results-show-specialized-hosts-are-doing-well";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2889:"<p>WPShout has <a href="http://wpshout.com/wordpress-hosting-review-2016-results/">published the results</a> of its 2016 <a href="http://wptavern.com/wpshout-is-accepting-submissions-for-its-2016-webhosting-survey">webhosting survey</a> taken by 135 respondents.

After pursuing official channels without receiving a response, the group&#8217;s members say that they are frustrated by a lack of communication:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Those of us who run some of the most popular projects on GitHub feel completely ignored by you. We’ve gone through the only support channel that you have given us either to receive an empty response or even no response at all. We have no visibility into what has happened with our requests, or whether GitHub is working on them.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Authors of the &#8220;<a href="https://github.com/dear-github/" target="_blank">Dear GitHub</a>&#8221; repository, which has no public members, collectively penned <a href="https://github.com/dear-github/dear-github" target="_blank">an earnest letter</a> that outlines three critical problems they perceive with the way issues currently work.</p>\n<p>The first problem the group states is a lack of features for GitHub issues, and they propose a simple solution:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Issues are often filed missing crucial information like reproduction steps or version tested. We’d like issues to gain custom fields, along with a mechanism (such as a mandatory issue template, perhaps powered by a newissue.md in root as a likely-simple solution) for ensuring they are filled out in every issue.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The group is also calling for GitHub to create a &#8220;first-class voting system&#8221; that would declutter the ubiquitous &#8220;+1&#8243;&#8216;s that litter nearly every popular project&#8217;s issues queue. They recognize the +1s as important feedback but demand a better UI to organize this information:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Issues often accumulate content-less “+1” comments which serve only to spam the maintainers and any others subscribed to the issue. These +1s serve a valuable function in letting maintainers know how widespread an issue is, but their drawbacks are too great. We’d like issues to gain a first-class voting system, and for content-less comments like “+1” or “:+1:” or “me too” to trigger a warning and instructions on how to use the voting mechanism.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The third issue directly impacts the open source workflow, which becomes inefficient when issues and requests are improperly submitted. The proposed solution streamlines important information that guides users toward submitting meaningful contributions:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Issues and pull requests are often created without any adherence to the CONTRIBUTING.md contribution guidelines, due to the inconspicuous nature of the “guidelines for contributing” link when creating an issue and the fact that it often contains a lot of information that isn’t relevant to opening issues (such as information about hacking on the project). Maintainers should be able to configure a file in the repo (interpreted as GFM) to be displayed at the top of the new issue / PR page instead of that link. Maintainers can choose to inline content there and / or link to other pages as appropriate.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Authors of the letter have waited years for progress on these issues. The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oGsg02jS-PnlIMJ3OlWIOEmhtG-udTwuDz_vsQPBHKs/htmlview?usp=sharing&sle=true" target="_blank">600+ project maintainers who have signed the document</a> are incapable of making these changes themselves, since GitHub&#8217;s infrastructure is not open source.</p>\n<h3>GitHub&#8217;s Paying Customers Don&#8217;t Share the Same Problems as Open Source Project Maintainers</h3>\n<p>With more than <a href="https://github.com/about/press" target="_blank">12 million people collaborating across 31 million repositories</a> as of January 2015, GitHub is home to the largest collection of code on the planet. Its emphasis on &#8220;social coding&#8221; and free hosting for public projects has made GitHub the defacto place to make code available for collaboration. As a result, many free users often forget that it&#8217;s the <a href="https://enterprise.github.com/home" target="_blank">GitHub Enterprise</a> customers who keep the lights on at the company.</p>\n<p>Julian Dunn, a product manager at <a href="http://www.chef.io/" target="_blank">Chef</a>, wrote <a href="http://www.juliandunn.net/2016/01/14/dear-dear-github-from-your-local-friendly-product-person/" target="_blank">a response to the &#8220;Dear GitHub&#8221; letter</a>. He contends that GitHub, unless forced by heated press coverage, isn&#8217;t likely to address these concerns.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If I were the product manager for GitHub, the answer to your requests would probably be &#8216;no,''&#8221; Dunn said. &#8220;That’s not because I think your feature requests aren’t legitimate. It’s because they don’t impact paying customers very highly. And as a company whose developers have to eat, GitHub is probably going to prioritize those customers first.&#8221;</p>\n<p>His reasoning is that the issue management problems that plague open source communities don&#8217;t affect GitHub&#8217;s bread and butter to the same degree.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Paying customers use private repositories and/or GitHub Enterprise, and the wild[er]-west aspects of an open-source ecosystem simply don’t exist inside a company,&#8221; Dunn said. &#8220;You’re unlikely to see +1-DDoS-type behavior inside private repos, for example.&#8221;</p>\n<p>GitHub has yet to officially address the &#8220;Dear GitHub&#8221; letter. With a growing list of more than 600 maintainers of popular open source projects signing the document, it will soon be in the company&#8217;s best interest to communicate a response. Authors of the letter are hoping the company will choose to act in support of its open source community to solve the unique challenges that project maintainers contend with when hosting on GitHub.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re an open source project maintainer, is this a letter you would sign? Does the current way that GitHub issues are structured satisfy the needs of your project and its users? Would the proposed solutions make a difference for your project?</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 15 Jan 2016 22:06:01 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:36:"WPTavern: Happy 15th Birthday Drupal";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=50632";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:46:"http://wptavern.com/happy-15th-birthday-drupal";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4754:"<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/birthday.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-23622"><img class="size-full wp-image-23622" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/birthday.jpg?resize=1023%2C561" alt="photo credit: A30_Tsitika - cc" /></a>photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/frozen-in-time/2263904827/">A30_Tsitika</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/">cc</a>\n<p><a href="https://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a>, the open source CMS founded by Dries Buytaert on December 29th, 2000, <a href="http://buytaert.net/drupal-15-years-old-and-still-gaining-momentum">is 15 years old</a>. Drupal version 1.0.0 was released on January 15th, 2001, &#8220;The early decisions to open-source Drupal and use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">GPL license</a> set the cornerstone principles for how our community shares with one another and builds upon each other&#8217;s achievements to this day,&#8221; Buytaert said.</p>\n<p>You might be wondering why a site devoted to WordPress is publishing a story about a competing CMS&#8217; birthday. The fact is, Drupal, Joomla and WordPress are more complimentary than they are competitors. Each is open source, licensed under the GPL, and is composed of code submitted by thousands of volunteers located across the world. All three projects make up a combined total of 37 years of experience.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drupal &#8211; 15 Years Old</li>\n<li>WordPress &#8211; 12 Years Old</li>\n<li>Joomla &#8211; 10 Years Old</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When Buytaert founded Drupal, many of the social networking services and browsers we enjoy today didn&#8217;t exist:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Chrome, Firefox, and Safari didn&#8217;t exist yet; most people used Netscape, Opera or Internet Explorer. New ideas for sharing and exchanging content such as &#8216;public diaries&#8217; and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a> had yet to gain widespread acceptance and Drupal was among the first to support those. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Wikipedia">Wikipedia was launched on the same day as Drupal</a> and sparked the rise of user-generated content. Facebook and Twitter didn&#8217;t exist until 4-5 years later</p></blockquote>\n<p>He describes many of the things Drupal got right like hooks and modules. There are some things the project got wrong such as adding support for OpenID which never gained widespread adoption.</p>\n<p>Near the end of his post, Buytaert reaffirms his commitment through the Drupal project to protect the privacy, serendipity and freedom of the web we enjoy, &#8220;As the web evolves from a luxury to a basic human right, it&#8217;s important that we treat it that way. To increase our impact, we have to continue to make Drupal easier to use. I&#8217;d love to help <a href="http://buytaert.net/winning-back-the-open-web">build a world where people&#8217;s privacy is safe</a> and Drupal is more approachable.&#8221;</p>\n<p>At the <a href="https://videopress.com/v/cmA03MuQ">State of the Word</a> at WordCamp US last year, Matt Mullenweg announced a similar role for WordPress. At the 46:58 mark, Mullenweg discusses WordPress&#8217; APIs being the key to an open web.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At a time when web services are <a href="http://thenextweb.com/twitter/2012/06/30/developers-bracing-themselves-for-twitter-api-retrictions-call-todays-post-ominous/#gref">restricting their APIs</a> to third-party developers, WordPress which is used across 25% of the web with open APIs can help reverse the trend, &#8220;I think that we can use this opening up, especially switching to API driven development to open up more of the web. When you think about what open source looks like, when the code being available isn&#8217;t the most important thing, when we&#8217;re interacting across multiple devices, the APIs become just as important as the code itself being open,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, check out this interview where Mullenweg and Buytaert share the same stage in 2011 at an event called <a href="http://www.schipulcon.com/">Schipulcon</a>. In the interview, the duo discuss open source software and their experience managing open source projects. One of the key takeaways from the interview is Buytaert&#8217;s response when asked, how WordPress&#8217; existence benefits Drupal, &#8220;If WordPress wins, Drupal wins, because it means open source wins.&#8221;</p>\n<div class="embed-wrap"></div>\n<p>Like Joomla and WordPress, Drupal is a champion of open source.

I hope to have something like that for the next version,&#8221; Martella told the Tavern.</p>\n<p>If you want to change the design of Story Lines, Martella suggests editing the <strong>story-lines</strong>, <strong>.story-lines</strong>, and <strong>.title classes</strong> with the caveat that you may have to use the <strong>!important </strong>declaration. You should save these changes to a child theme so they&#8217;re not lost when you update the plugin. The list items use the same font as the active theme.</p>\n<p>Martella has a background in journalism and is the sports editor for <a href="http://www.dailytexanonline.com/">The Daily Texan</a>. While journalism is his first passion, he&#8217;s slowly transitioning to the web development world by creating themes and plugins for WordPress:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’ve been trying to figure out a niche for myself in the WordPress development world and I’m starting to think it might be creating themes and plugins that replicate what people see on the New York Times or other top newspaper websites for others to use on their sites.</p>\n<p>My first plugin, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jm-breaking-news/">JM Breaking News</a>, and the <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/giornalismo">Giornalismo</a> theme I created are also examples of that. So really, I’m just trying to explore the niche where web development and journalism collide and WordPress is the tool I’m using to do just that.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There are two features I&#8217;d like to see added in a future release. The first, is the ability to rearrange highlights with a drag-and-drop interface. The second, is a way to add a URL which links to an anchor point in the article so readers can visit specific parts of a story.</p>\n<p>I tested Story Lines on WordPress 4.5 alpha and it works as expected. It&#8217;s <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/story-lines/">available for free</a> from the WordPress plugin directory.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 15 Jan 2016 11:50:35 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:75:"WPTavern: New Upvato Service Offers Free Backups for Envato Market Products";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=50606";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:85:"http://wptavern.com/new-upvato-service-offers-free-backups-for-envato-market-products";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5720:"<p>If you&#8217;ve ever purchased files from Envato, chances are that you have them backed up locally or sent to a cloud storage service like Dropbox. <a href="https://www.upvato.com/" target="_blank">Upvato</a> is a new alternative that specializes in <a href="http://market.envato.com/" target="_blank">Envato Market</a> files. The free service allows Envato customers to back up their purchased files. Upvato takes a complete backup of the screenshots, descriptions, titles, and author information. In the event that an item is removed from Envato, customers who have uploaded their files to Upvato have a complete backup.</p>\n<p>Freddy Lundekvam, owner of Norway-based <a href="http://www.logik.no/" target="_blank">Logik Web Studios</a>, said that he was inspired to create Upvato after losing purchased files due to the fact that Envato &#8220;<a href="https://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202500244-The-Item-Has-Been-Removed" target="_blank">does not guarantee ongoing availability of items</a> after the initial download.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m a heavy user of Themeforest,&#8221; Lundekvam said. &#8220;I’m a full time programmer who doesn’t know much about design, and I’m especially a huge fan of the admin templates and own 15+ of them. In total, amongst all the marketplaces I’ve bought quite a few items. Having purchased many files, I quickly learned about Envato’s right to take down and remove any file at their or the author&#8217;s sole discretion without any warning. I personally have lost 10 files because of this policy, and I find it quite annoying to lose files.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Lundekvam used to back up his files to Dropbox but found it frustrating to sort through his library without much information and no way to look them up after they disappeared from Envato. He teamed up with a colleague who is a designer and created Upvato as a solution to this problem. In addition to storing the file you purchased, Upvato also stores the screenshots, file descriptions, comments, and includes versioning &#8211; allowing you access to any version that has been uploaded.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/upvato-backup.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50616"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/upvato-backup.png?resize=908%2C615" alt="upvato-backup" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50616" /></a></p>\n<p>Users can back up an unlimited number of files and there&#8217;s no limit on the file size. Upvato creators are also committed to keeping the service free, according to the statement on their website:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Upvato is and will always fee a completely free service. We strongly believe that this is something that should be a part of Envato from day one and don&#8217;t agree with their policies.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The service uses the Envato API to allow users to back up all of their files automatically. Files can also be uploaded manually into your Upvato account.</p>\n<h3>Envato&#8217;s Response to the New Upvato Backup Service</h3>\n<p>While Envato does not officially endorse Upvato, the company encourages users to find a backup solution. Venessa Paech, Envato PR Manager, gave WP Tavern the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Envato buyers use a variety of methods for managing their purchases. Whatever service they use, whether Dropbox or a service like Upvato, we always encourage people to back up their digital assets. </p>\n<p>Envato Market is an active marketplace with thousands of sellers and millions of items. While we offer a downloads section on every account, our focus is less on post-purchase asset management, and more on discovering and purchasing wonderful digital goods that solve creative challenges.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Essentially, after the purchase has been made, Envato doesn&#8217;t find any conflict in users choosing Upvato as a backup solution. The company is unlikely to change its policy about not guaranteeing files indefinitely, as it needs to account for all kinds of circumstances including copyright complaints and technical problems. Upvato&#8217;s free backup solution may reduce the number of Envato customers who are negatively impacted when files are removed without notice.</p>\n<h3>&#8220;Storage Space is Cheap&#8221; and Upvato Doesn&#8217;t Plan to Monetize</h3>\n<p>I asked Lundekvam how he&#8217;s funding the enormous amount of space required to store files for Envato customers. &#8220;Storage space is cheap these days &#8211; hosting 10 TB of data in an Amazon Glacier is merely $7 a month,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I also take benefit from the automated uploads.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you connect your Envato account and back up the item, then only one file for that item will be used for all users who have the same file (Verified purchased with Envato). Every time you try to download a backup of the file from Envato, we check if the exact same file already exists amongst the items available files. If it does, it’s not stored. Instead, you use the same file that already exist in the system,&#8221; Lundekvam said.</p>\n<p>Despite having created a service that solves a real problem for potentially thousands of customers, Lundekvam said he&#8217;s not seeking a revenue model to fund his efforts. For now, the site exists to solve a problem he encountered that also affects many other Envato customers. Monetization isn&#8217;t a priority for him at this time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Currently that’s not the plan,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Running such a site isn’t all that expensive. For now, we just wanted to make something cool and useful that people might want and need.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 15 Jan 2016 06:50:14 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:65:"WPTavern: Human Made Publishes Free WordPress REST API Whitepaper";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=50558";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:75:"http://wptavern.com/human-made-publishes-free-wordpress-rest-api-whitepaper";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3066:"<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wp-rest-api.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-43000"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wp-rest-api.jpg?resize=1025%2C469" alt="wp-rest-api" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-43000" /></a></p>\n<p>Today Human Made released its new <a href="https://hmn.md/wordpress-rest-api-white-paper/" target="_blank">WordPress REST API Whitepaper</a>, an in-depth guide to how the API is changing the way developers interact with WordPress.

Quick works for <a href="https://hmn.md/" target="_blank">Human Made</a> and is a WordPress core contributor. He is also the lead contributor on <a href="https://github.com/Chassis/Chassis" target="_blank">Chassis</a>, a lightweight WP Vagrant install that uses Puppet for provisioning.</p>\n<p>John James Jacoby set up <a href="https://github.com/buddypress/BP-REST" target="_blank">a GitHub repository</a> where development for the BP REST API will take place. In summarizing the meeting&#8217;s discussion regarding planning and architecture, Quick said, &#8220;Planning how we tackle this is very important rather than diving straight into the code. As we’re &#8216;standing on the shoulders of giants&#8217; we can use the lessons learned from the WP REST API project and put in time at the start to plan this properly.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It makes sense to plan out the data we would like returned from endpoints and how they relate to each other with _links. For example, if we’re displaying the data for the activities endpoint rather than showing a user_id we should link this to a user endpoint.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The team will be taking a “schema first” approach and plans to adhere to Test Driven Development &#8211; planning an endpoint, writing tests that fail then writing the code for the endpoint until the tests pass.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is something that’s often talked about as being an ideal development methodology but it’s rarely practiced in the WordPress space,&#8221; Quick said. &#8220;Tackling a project this way should mean less bugs although I do realize this could be a blocker for new contributors.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The BP REST API team plans to tackle read-only endpoints first for the activity stream and xprofile components via the _links method Quick outlined. Ryan Fugate opened a GitHub <a href="https://github.com/buddypress/BP-REST/issues/1" target="_blank">issue</a> regarding the plugin&#8217;s folder structure/loader, and the plan is to design it as a feature plugin that will one day land in BuddyPress core.</p>\n<h3>What is the Purpose of a BP REST API?</h3>\n<p>During the meeting contributors discussed the primary problems that a BP REST API should solve, which Quick summarized in the <a href="https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2016/01/14/bp-rest-api-dev-chat-summary-for-january-14-2016/" target="_blank">meeting notes</a>.</p>\n<p>The team agreed that the main purpose for building the API is to expose BuddyPress data in a RESTful way so that developers and site owners can use it to create plugins, mobile apps, or anything else they want.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The other main purpose for the BP REST API is that we can use the endpoints going forward to alter some things internally in BuddyPress, as in the past &#8216;the functions throughout BuddyPress are very purpose built to solve one specific theme-side problem,''&#8221; Quick said.</p>\n<p>If you want to get involved in building a REST API for BuddyPress make sure to <a href="https://github.com/buddypress/BP-REST/" target="_blank">follow the project on GitHub</a> and jump into the discussion happening in the #buddypress Slack channel.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 14 Jan 2016 19:28:19 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 221 – Interview With Micah Mitchell of Memberium";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"http://wptavern.com?p=50567&preview_id=50567";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:83:"http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-221-interview-with-micah-mitchell-of-memberium";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1810:"<p>In this episode of WordPress Weekly, <a href="http://marcuscouch.com/">Marcus Couch</a> and I are joined by Micah Mitchell, who is a partner in <a href="https://memberium.com/">Memberium</a>, a membership development and management plugin for WordPress that connects with <a href="http://www.infusionsoft.com/">Infusionsoft</a>.</p>\n<p>During the show, we discuss what Memberium has to offer for those who want to create membership sites using WordPress.

That&#8217;s why many users have opted to set up a pin lock for the app. (You can find this under Settings >> Turn Pin lock on.)

The published patent describes how Google factors in page speed when presenting results:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A search result for a resource having a short load time relative to resources having longer load times can be promoted in a presentation order, and search results for the resources having longer load times can be demoted. The demotion can, in some situations, result in a search result for a resource having a short load time being presented earlier in the order than a search result for a similarly-relevant resource having a longer load time. Thus, for two resources that, apart from load times, appear to equally satisfy a user&#8217;s informational needs, the user will often select the resource that will likely load the most quickly of the two, resulting in a better user experience.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In other words, when it comes to competing resources that might seem otherwise similar, the one that loads faster gets a higher ranking. Prioritizing site speed is not only <a href="https://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2010/04/using-site-speed-in-web-search-ranking.html" target="_blank">important for Google rankings</a>, it&#8217;s also critical to providing the best experience for visitors.</p>\n<p>The new <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-asset-clean-up/" target="_blank">WP Asset Clean Up</a> plugin addresses an often overlooked aspect of improving loading times. The plugin allows you to selectively remove unused styles and scripts from any page or post on your site. Once activated, the plugin detects all assets loaded and displays them on the post/page editing screen. You can then select the assets that are not needed for that page.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/wp-asset-clean-up.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50520"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/wp-asset-clean-up.png?resize=1025%2C902" alt="wp-asset-clean-up" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50520" /></a></p>\n<p>I tested it and found that it works as expected. It&#8217;s especially handy for home pages and content like &#8220;about&#8221; and &#8220;contact&#8221; pages where you don&#8217;t need to load as much functionality.</p>\n<p>WP Asset Clean Up is developer <a href="http://www.bitrepository.com" target="_blank">Gabriel Livan</a>&#8216;s first free plugin on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve used themes / plugins in the past that were loading lots of assets (.css and .js files) in the front-end in pages where you only needed half of them or even less,&#8221; Livan said. &#8220;Many people have articles about making WordPress faster, but they often overlooked this part of removing the unused files. Often these are minified by caching plugins, but using the plugin I&#8217;ve developed, the minifying will be even smaller.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As long as plugin/theme authors have properly enqueued their assets, WP Asset Clean Up will be able to detect them so that you can select them for removal. The plugin helps you decrease the number of HTTP requests loaded but can also be useful for minimizing script conflicts. You can download <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-asset-clean-up/" target="_blank">WP Asset Clean Up</a> from WordPress.org and use it in combination with your favorite caching plugin to improve performance.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 13 Jan 2016 06:29:03 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:80:"WPTavern: BuddyPress 2.5 Development Kicks Off, BP-API Dev Chat Begins This Week";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=50466";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:89:"http://wptavern.com/buddypress-2-5-development-kicks-off-bp-api-dev-chat-begins-this-week";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3693:"<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/buddypress-wallpapers1.png" rel="attachment wp-att-16156"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/buddypress-wallpapers1.png?resize=800%2C450" alt="buddypress-wallpapers" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16156" /></a></p>\n<p>BuddyPress contributors <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/buddypress/p1452110516002730" target="_blank">met last week</a> to discuss the scope of the 2.5 release, which is slated for the beginning of March.

All three plugins are developed by, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/johnjamesjacoby/">John James Jacoby,</a> and are part of <a href="http://wptavern.com/stuttter-plugins-now-available-on-wordpress-org">his Stuttter project</a>.</p>\n<p>Note, that in order to assign icons, images, and colors to taxonomies in WordPress 4.3 or earlier using these plugins, you&#8217;ll need to install and activate the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-term-meta/">WP Term Meta</a> plugin as it adds Term Meta support.</p>\n<p>Once all three plugins are installed and activated, browse to the Categories section of the WordPress backend. You&#8217;ll see new fields where you can assign an icon, color, and image. Icons use the <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/resource/dashicons/#admin-appearance">Dashicon set</a> that ships with WordPress.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SelectingAnIcon.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50481"><img class="size-full wp-image-50481" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SelectingAnIcon.png?resize=682%2C334" alt="Icon Picker" /></a>Icon Picker\n<p>Choosing a color is easy as WP Term Colors uses the built-in color picker provided by WordPress.</p>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SelectingAColor.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50484"><img class="size-full wp-image-50484" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/SelectingAColor.png?resize=686%2C562" alt="Assigning a color to Taxonomies" /></a>Assigning A Color to Taxonomies\n<p>WP Term Images uses the WordPress Media Library to assign an image.

In a future update, I&#8217;d like to see visual queues in the same areas of the WordPress backend where a taxonomy is displayed. For example, displaying the icon, color, or image for a category on the Post management screen. The category management page is something I rarely visit once a site is established. However, I visit the Post management screen on a daily basis. At the same time, I question the usefulness of displaying something next to individual tags.</p>\n<p>These plugins are examples of what&#8217;s possible with taxonomy term meta support in WordPress 4.4. I tested each plugin on WordPress 4.5 alpha and didn&#8217;t experience any problems. If you&#8217;d like to learn more about term meta and how to use it, I encourage you to <a href="http://themehybrid.com/weblog/introduction-to-wordpress-term-meta">read this tutorial</a> by Justin Tadlock. What use cases or scenarios can you think of where the visual queues described above would come in handy?</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 12 Jan 2016 12:17:21 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:76:"WPTavern: Easily Hide Menus in WordPress With The Clean WP Admin Menu Plugin";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=50469";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:86:"http://wptavern.com/easily-hide-menus-in-wordpress-with-the-clean-wp-admin-menu-plugin";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2400:"<p>The WordPress admin menu is fairly easy to navigate out-of-the-box but can become unruly over time.

It went faster than any year I can remember, absolutely flew by. Luckily it was capped at the holidays with a precious few weeks of downtime in Houston. Now I&#8217;m back to work in Cape Town and just finished a lovely day of great food, wine, and conversation with colleagues who are here for a meetup starting tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Since I started tracking, 2015 was the first year that I traveled fewer miles than the year before, clocking in at 398k, down 27k. (398,553 miles, 111 cities, 20 countries.) In 2016 I&#8217;m going to try and get that even lower. It was also one of my best years for blogging on this site, with the most posts (252) I&#8217;ve made since 2008, and the most words (24,605) since 2005. (If anyone is curious, I wrote about 60k words over the same time period in <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic&#8217;s</a> internal <a href="http://p2theme.com/">P2s</a>.) In a weird omission, though, it&#8217;s the first year since this site started in 2002 that I didn&#8217;t post a single gallery of photos. I&#8217;ve developed a mental block around processing and posting the fancier pictures, even as I carry hundreds of gigabytes of them around the planet several times over. Hopefully this is something I can get past in 2016.</p>\n<p>I ran 163 miles in 2015, more than I did the year before, and I think that trend will continue. Last year <a href="https://ma.tt/2015/01/thirty-one/">I talked about habits and small actions</a>, and a daily todo list with some small items to nourish the mind, soul, and body has become central to my routine. I dyed my hair (grey) just for fun and also to show the rest of Automattic they could too, how you look doesn&#8217;t matter one iota. My restaurant quest has continued, and I&#8217;ve now been to 38% of <a href="http://www.theworlds50best.com/list/1-50-winners">the current top 50 list</a>.</p>\n<p>More so than before, I really don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s around the corner. While there is a lot in motion, there is even more still being defined and started. There&#8217;s freedom in the groove, to reference <a href="http://joshuaredman.com/">Joshua Redman&#8217;s</a> great album, and I&#8217;m getting a lot more comfortable with ambiguity and the faster pace of life in general. More than ever, I consider myself incredibly lucky, so it&#8217;s exciting to make the most of the opportunity that the volatility, love, loss, glory, failure, inspirations, and setbacks that 2016 will bring.</p>\n<p>Previously: <a href="https://ma.tt/2003/01/bday/">19</a>, <a href="https://ma.tt/2004/01/so-im-20/">20</a>, <a href="https://ma.tt/2005/01/hot-barely-legal-matt/">21</a>, <a href="https://ma.tt/2006/01/matt-22/">22</a>, <a href="https://ma.tt/2007/01/twenty-three/">23</a>, <a href="https://ma.tt/2008/01/twenty-four/">24</a>, <a href="https://ma.tt/2009/01/twenty-five/">25</a>, <a href="https://ma.tt/2010/01/twenty-six/">26</a>, <a href="https://ma.tt/2011/01/twenty-seven/">27</a>, <a href="https://ma.tt/2012/01/twenty-eight/">28</a>, <a href="https://ma.tt/2013/01/twenty-nine/">29</a>, <a href="https://ma.tt/2014/01/matt-3-0/">30</a>, and <a href="https://ma.tt/2015/01/thirty-one/">31</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 11 Jan 2016 23:58:27 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:57:"WPTavern: Stuttter Plugins Now Available on WordPress.org";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=50441";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:67:"http://wptavern.com/stuttter-plugins-now-available-on-wordpress-org";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4714:"<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/stuttter.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50449"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/stuttter.png?resize=1025%2C452" alt="stuttter" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50449" /></a></p>\n<p>The whole collection of plugins from John James Jacoby&#8217;s <a href="http://jaco.by/2015/10/16/meet-stuttter/" target="_blank">Stuttter project</a> is now <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/stuttter/#content-plugins" target="_blank">available on WordPress.org</a>.

After completing this project, Jacoby returned to consulting via Flox where he had the chance to test and use the Stuttter plugins in production.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s a way to independently test the waters for what we can do with it [WordPress], without deviating from its history, beauty, charm, and chutzpah,&#8221; Jacoby said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was recently inspired by Jeremy Felt’s <a href="https://jeremyfelt.com/2015/10/02/what-wordpress-plugins-are-excellent/" target="_blank">post about what he looks for in plugins</a> that he would want to use. We’ve chatted about it before, and he finally put it into words. Stuttter sticks to those philosophies (no nags, no licenses, nothing to cut out, etc…),&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The new <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/stuttter/#content-plugins" target="_blank">Stuttter profile on WordPress.org</a> is home to 18 lean plugins, each carefully chiseled to do one thing well.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/stuttter-plugins.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50458"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/stuttter-plugins.png?resize=1025%2C1001" alt="stuttter-plugins" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50458" /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;My end goal is to point most public facing links for each plugin to a product on <a href="https://store.flox.io/" target="_blank">store.flox.io</a> (using Easy Digital Downloads) and sell them for a few pennies, and then use WordPress.org for updates and distribution,&#8221; Jacoby said. &#8220;That way people get a zip of a plugin they purchased and get to &#8216;own&#8217; their copy, plus I have a record of their purchase on <a href="https://flox.io/" target="_blank">flox.io</a> so they can use that plugin on their hosted networks eventually too.</p>\n<p>Jacoby plans to make the Stuttter plugins available on Flox for the communities hosted there.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Many of them will be on by default, like WP Chosen and WP Pretty Filters,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Others will be &#8216;unlocked&#8217; through purchases, like User Activity and User Parents.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The goal is to strike a balance between a good default experience, and letting people upgrade through purchases, and then being able to take those purchases with them if they decide to self-host eventually (vs. losing them like on wpcom),&#8221; Jacoby said.</p>\n<p>Developers who are interested in the code can find the Stuttter plugins <a href="https://code.flox.io/groups/stuttter/" target="_blank">publicly mirrored on Flox</a>. They are actively developed there and then pushed out to <a href="https://github.com/stuttter" target="_blank">GitHub</a> in bulk.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Almost all of these are ideas I’ve been imagining in one way or another for years, particularly WP User Profiles,&#8221; Jacoby said. &#8220;I’ve wanted that for BuddyPress forever, but it’s always been too big of a gamble to commit to something this drastic for a project like BuddyPress that is so well established.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think whenever you have a long time to imagine what life would be like once something is possible, you can execute very quickly once it is. Most of the current generation Stuttter plugins came rapid-fire because of several years of thought about them first. I hadn’t even done much research into alternatives (the Stream plugin vs. WP User Activity for example, and WooCommerce has its own Term Meta tweaks too). I just knew I wanted to solve a certain problem in a certain way, and had the time and motivation to make it happen,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 11 Jan 2016 22:09:49 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:26:"Matt: Interview in El Pais";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=45737";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"https://ma.tt/2016/01/interview-in-el-pais/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:314:"<p><span class="embed-youtube"></span></p>\n<p>If you speak Spanish, or know someone who does, check out this video and <a href="http://one.elpais.com/gracias-a-el-se-publica-la-cuarta-parte-de-las-webs-del-mundo-matt-mullenweg-fundador-de-wordpress/">article that was on the El Pais homepage earlier today</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 08 Jan 2016 22:48:19 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:83:"WPTavern: WordCamp Europe 2016 Sold Out, Organizers Working to Get More Venue Space";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=50345";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:92:"http://wptavern.com/wordcamp-europe-2016-sold-out-organizers-working-to-get-more-venue-space";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2701:"<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/wceu-2016.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49423"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/wceu-2016.png?resize=1025%2C407" alt="wceu-2016" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49423" /></a></p>\n<p>If you waited to buy your ticket to <a href="https://2016.europe.wordcamp.org/" target="_blank">WordCamp Europe 2016</a> in Vienna, you may be out of luck. The event sold out on December 31, 2015. All 1550 tickets, including 50 micro-sponsorship tickets are now gone.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re currently at full capacity of our venue, but working towards expanding by hiring more halls in the MuzeumQuartier so we can meet the strong demand,&#8221; organizer Petya Raykovska told the Tavern.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We will try and release 200 more tickets in the days to follow, depending on the availability of the halls around the MQ,&#8221; she said. A <a href="https://2016.europe.wordcamp.org/wordcamp-europe-is-sold-out-sign-up-for-the-tickets-waiting-list/" target="_blank">waiting list</a> is now open for those hopeful to grab a ticket when more venue space opens up. According to Raykovska, the list already has nearly 100 signups.</p>\n<p>Based on the attendees confirmed so far, WordCamp Europe 2016 will have 58 countries represented, which is six more than the event had in 2014 and 2015. Including micro-sponsor tickets, the countries with the highest number of attendees include Germany (8%), Netherlands (8%), UK (8%), Austria (7%), and the United States (6%).</p>\n<p>Planning early has paid off for the organizing team with another year of successful ticket sales in the bag. Raykovska attributes this to the location and the quality of past WCEU events.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Obviously, Vienna being central for Europe and a fabulous location, has helped us attract more people this year,&#8221; Raykovska said. &#8220;But I believe above all, the huge interest is a testament about the quality we&#8217;ve been able to provide in previous years, establishing WordCamp Europe as a can&#8217;t-miss event for anyone running or involved with a WordPress business.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I also think people appreciate that we released tickets so early. More than 80% of WordCamp Europe attendees come from outside the host country so being able to plan early helped people make a decision,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://2016.europe.wordcamp.org/the-call-for-speakers-for-wceu-2016-closes-in-4-weeks/" target="_blank">call for speakers</a> will close on January 31st.

Jenny Beaumont is co-organizer of WordCamp Paris &amp; WordCamp Europe, a frequent speaker at WordCamps in France and abroad, and a contributor to a number of blogs. After 17 years building things in and around the web, she is taking a year-long sabbatical to get a new outlook on life.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>If you’ve organized a WordCamp or similar event, then you know the work involved in managing a call for papers. With every submission comes lots of information, both about the candidate and the proposed talk. And with some candidates submitting multiple proposals, the total number of submissions can be 3-4 times the number of slots available.</p>\n<p>The call for speakers for <a href="https://paris.wordcamp.org/2016/" target="_blank">WordCamp Paris 2016</a> brought in upwards of 70 candidates and over 100 proposals!</p>\n<p>In the past, most WordCamps have taken proposals through online forms and then organized them within spreadsheets for deliberation. But just as WordCamp Paris has grown in recent years, so has the organizing team, and the spreadsheet method became increasingly laborious and inefficient.</p>\n<h3>There’s a plugin for that</h3>\n<p>While preparing for <a href="https://paris.wordcamp.org/2015/" target="_blank">WordCamp Paris 2015</a>, the organizers decided to tackle this problem, and turned to <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-idea-stream/" target="_blank">WP Idea Stream</a>, a plugin developed by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/imath" target="_blank">Mathieu Viet</a> (who has since joined the organizing team).</p>\n<p>As the name suggests, WP Idea Stream is a collaborative tool built for the purpose of sharing and managing ideas between members of a WordPress site. A close look shows us that this simple concept contains a lot of intricate and useful features.</p>\n<h3>Advantages for users</h3>\n<p>Filling out a form one time is no trouble, but what if you want to submit multiple proposals? Or, what if you’re interrupted while filling out a form and have to start over?</p>\n<p>WP Idea Stream solves this problem by giving talk candidates a simple one-time sign-up. With their own account they can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Update their personal information at any time (name, biography, social media accounts, email address, phone number, etc)</li>\n<li>Submit multiple proposals without needing to resubmit personal information</li>\n<li>Edit each proposal for up to one hour after submission</li>\n<li>Access and consult their submissions at any time</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Advantages for organizers</h3>\n<p>Some team members wait until closing to sit and evaluate the proposals in one go, while others prefer to react over time as talks roll in. How do you keep track of those you’ve seen? How do you exchange thoughts and opinions with your teammates? How do you navigate through all of this information?</p>\n<h3>Vote</h3>\n<p>WP Idea Stream uses a five-star rating system to vote on ideas (or talks in our case). This makes it easy to see which are the most popular among a large group of organizers.</p>\n<p>The plugin settings page includes an easy way to customize the wording for each level.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/hover-captions.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50387"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/hover-captions.png?resize=1025%2C133" alt="hover-captions" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50387" /></a></p>\n<h3>Comment and debate</h3>\n<p>To compliment this voting system, organizers can leave comments on each submission to further bolster their argument for or against a talk. They also have the opportunity to point out information that might be lacking, ask questions of the candidate, or make notes of recurring themes that emerge.</p>\n<h3>Track and filter</h3>\n<p>As an administrator, there are two ways to view talk proposals: the main “post” view, and a view from within your own profile.</p>\n<p><strong>The “post” view</strong> is much like the default blog home page on a standard WordPress site. Submissions are listed in chronological descending order by default, including pagination and a display of the total number of talks to date. Then, there is the possibility to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Search by keyword</li>\n<li>Filter by votes (highest ratings first)</li>\n<li>Filter by most commented</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The excerpt for each talk submission includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The avatar of the candidate (candidates are encouraged to use the email address associated with their Gravatar account at sign up)</li>\n<li>The name of the talk</li>\n<li>The number of comments with a quick link to that section of the talk</li>\n<li>The current average rating, with a quick link to vote on that talk</li>\n<li>An excerpt of the talk description</li>\n<li>A list of all category and tag selections</li>\n<li>The date of submission</li>\n<li>A quick link to edit the proposal in the WordPress admin</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/excerpts.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50389"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/excerpts.png?resize=1025%2C778" alt="excerpts" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50389" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>The “profile” view</strong> is intended for subscribed users to view their own submissions and to manage their personal information. As an admin, this front-end view also includes some very useful tabs to help keep track of your participation in the deliberation process.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/profile-view.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50390"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/profile-view.png?resize=1025%2C737" alt="profile-view" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50390" /></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Published.</strong> Shows any and all submissions you might have made. Yes, WordCamp Paris organizers are also often speakers!</li>\n<li><strong>Commented.</strong> Shows all talk proposals that you’ve already commented on.</li>\n<li><strong>Evaluated.</strong> Shows all talk proposals that you’ve already voted on.</li>\n<li><strong>To be evaluated.</strong> Shows all talk proposals that are still awaiting your vote.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Organize</h3>\n<p>By default, WP Idea Stream comes with standard WordPress category and tag taxonomies, allowing submissions to be further classified and qualified. This year for WordCamp Paris, we used categories to represent three talk formats: 10, 20 and 30-minute preferences.</p>\n<p>We use tags for what we call talk “zooms” (basically just thematic tags). The advantage here is that, just like standard WordPress tags, users can be prompted with “most used” keywords to describe their talk’s theme.</p>\n<p>Categories and tags have quick links to filter the view by those terms.</p>\n<p>This has proven extremely useful for spotting recurring subjects and trends, comparing similar proposals, and even for figuring out subjects that haven’t been covered that we might want to find speakers for.</p>\n<h3>Export</h3>\n<p>When it comes down to it, you can’t get around the good old-fashioned spreadsheet for finalizing the job.</p>\n<p>Once the team has finished rating all of the talks, the submissions can be easily exported to a spreadsheet, and sorted by vote, theme, and talk duration. From here, the program is built up and finalized, and the bulk of the work is already done.</p>\n<h3>Requirements</h3>\n<p>Using WP Idea Stream does requires us to have and maintain a WordPress installation separate from our official WordCamp site, but this is also proving to have a number of advantages including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A dedicated domain for emails</li>\n<li>A permanent site that can act as a long-term archive, essentially regrouping information and links to each year’s dedicated site</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Customization</h3>\n<p>WP Idea Stream doesn’t work like this out-of-the-box. Many of these features were built specifically for our purposes. Because the plugin is developed to be highly extensible, adapting it for your own needs is relatively easy.</p>\n<h3>Templates</h3>\n<p>WP Idea Stream is built with a templating system, allowing you to easily override any of the front-end views from your own theme.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/templates.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50392"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/templates.png?resize=398%2C506" alt="templates" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50392" /></a></p>\n<h3>Custom functions</h3>\n<p>Placing a file named <a href="https://github.com/imath/wc-talk#wordcamp-talk" target="_blank">wp-idea-stream-custom.php</a> in wp-content/plugins/ extends the plugin, allowing you to build on the default functionality.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the features we’ve added to adapt the plugin to our needs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Publish the content (talks) in private mode</li>\n<li>Extended user fields, including language preference (the site then displays by default in the preferred language)</li>\n<li>Time limit for editing talk submissions</li>\n<li>Front-end admin tabs for viewing submissions by those rated and those still needing to be rated</li>\n<li>Back-end modifications so that the plugin name and icon are changed in the admin menu.</li>\n<li>Added a metabox with additional checkboxes to further classify talks by targeted audience</li>\n<li>Added user role of “speaker,” essentially with the same permissions as the standard “subscriber”.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also added a fun little function in case any candidates try to sneak a peek by hacking the site’s comment RSS feed:</p>\n<pre class="brush: php; light: true; title: ; notranslate">\n/**\n * Redirect the speaker trying to cheat by adding the feed argument to the talk url :)\n */\nfunction wc_talk_neutralize_feeds_step_two() {\n	if ( is_feed() &amp;&amp; wp_idea_stream_is_ideastream() ) {\n		wp_idea_stream_add_message( array(\n			''type''    =&gt; ''info'',\n			''content'' =&gt; __( ''Ah! caught trying to spy!'', ''wc-talk'' ),\n		) );\n		wp_safe_redirect( wp_idea_stream_get_redirect_url() );\n		exit();\n	}\n}\n</pre>\n<p>We have used this system for two consecutive years now, improving the functionality as we learn what features are needed to make the process as smooth and efficient as possible. Overall, we might actually spend more time on the process, but it’s qualitative time. These tools humanize the process, allowing us to easily navigate the information and further invest ourselves in both the candidates and their ideas.</p>\n<p>As a collaborative tool, it adds an element of fun that you can’t get out of a spreadsheet! This brings an added dynamic to the group, allowing us all to participate in the process and have a voice (except for those organizers who propose talks, of course! ;) ).</p>\n<p>Like the idea? You should give it a try!</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 08 Jan 2016 17:50:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:60:"WPTavern: Progress Report: Measure Jetpack Benchmark Project";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=50395";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"http://wptavern.com/progress-report-measure-jetpack-benchmark-project";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1062:"<p>Late in 2015, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/ideag/#content-plugins">Arūnas Liuiza</a>, a WordPress plugin developer, <a href="http://wptavern.com/measure-jetpack-an-independent-project-aimed-at-measuring-jetpacks-performance">announced a new project</a> called <a href="http://blog.arunas.co/project-measure-jetpack/">Measure Jetpack</a>.

Last year <a href="https://taylorlovett.com/" target="_blank">Taylor Lovett</a>, Director of Web Engineering at <a href="http://10up.com/" target="_blank">10up</a>, released version 6.0, a completely rewritten version that made it one of the first plugins to incorporate the new WP REST API. It is now one of the most popular plugins to do so and has more than 70,000 active installs.</p>\n<p>The plugin was built to provide the best user experience possible for building forms. It is unique in that it puts the form creation process inside the media manager, instead of a separate forms admin page. Custom Contact Forms also offers live previews while the user is building a form.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/custom-contact-form-creation.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50367"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/custom-contact-form-creation.png?resize=900%2C445" alt="custom-contact-form-creation" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50367" /></a></p>\n<p>Getting the REST API integrated with the plugin was the culmination of nine months of development for version 6.0. Unlike many other early plugins that rely on the API, Custom Contact Forms does not require the WP REST API plugin. Instead, the plugin includes its own version of the WP REST API, which is cleverly activated if necessary.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The plugin includes a small fraction of that code,&#8221; Lovett said. &#8220;Compressed it is 1.6MB and the whole thing is built to be very performant scale for enterprise.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a good user experience to make 70,000 people install a plugin dependency,&#8221; Lovett said. &#8220;The main thing about CCF is it has an attractive fully JS powered interface that looks like the WP media modal. It really goes with Matt&#8217;s message at the State of the Word on JS.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I would argue the user experience is better than all the popular alternatives (Gravity Forms, Ninja Forms, etc.) The plugin does not have as much functionality as GF or Ninja Forms but is quickly catching up &#8211; it&#8217;s also 100% free,&#8221; Lovett said.</p>\n<p>Since Custom Contact Forms is capable of handling much more than simple contact forms, Lovett is considering a name change that will help people understand the broader possibilities for its use. He has seen it used for employment forms, product creation (the plugin has extensive hooks and can create posts on each submission), digital product creation, and event creation.</p>\n<h3>JavaScript-Powered Form Creation is the Future</h3>\n<p>Lovett believes that the most popular forms plugins will need to adapt in order to keep pace with the modern web.</p>\n<p>&#8220;By using the REST API and heavy JS, CCF can do things like live form previews which Gravity Forms and Ninja Forms can&#8217;t do,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The modern web requires things to be done without page reloads so I do think the traditional form plugins will need to modernize. The only thing standing in their way is time &#8211; I spent nine months rewriting CCF for the JSON REST API,&#8221; Lovett said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;AJAX has become expected on the web. Anything less is not going to stand the test of time. Can you imagine using the media modal, if you had to reload the page every time you added an image? The same concept applies to forms,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Custom Contact Forms is not as full-featured as the most popular contact forms, and Lovett says he gets quite a bit of pressure from users to add more features.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I want to tastefully add features slowly,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think a lot of plugins try to do all the things and I don&#8217;t want CCF to be like that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Lovett plans to add Paypal and Stripe integration along with a variety of form templates in future releases. When asked if these would be separate add-ons, he said that they would mostly likely be built in.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The only reason to separate things in my opinion is to make money off of them,&#8221; Lovett said. &#8220;The plugin will still be a small file size and performant &#8211; so why separate?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Lovett has struggled to maintain a high rating on Custom Contact Forms, as it went through a tough transition in order to adapt the JSON REST API.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I had to write DB upgrade scripts for thousands of people using the old plugin,&#8221; he said. &#8220;During that transition, I got a lot of 1-star reviews.&#8221; The database upgrade scripts provided a seamless transition for some users but not for others. This is sometimes the price users pay when a plugin updates to be on the cutting edge.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The JSON REST API being merged into core has made support much easier,&#8221; Lovett said. &#8220;I don’t think it’s &#8216;fringe technology&#8217; anymore.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 08 Jan 2016 00:07:42 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 220 – Automattic’s Relationship With WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"http://wptavern.com?p=50342&preview_id=50342";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:80:"http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-220-automattics-relationship-with-wordpress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2654:"<p>In this episode of WordPress Weekly, <a href="http://marcuscouch.com/">Marcus Couch</a> and I discuss the latest news in the WordPress ecosystem.

Late in the year, the service <a href="http://wptavern.com/automattic-unveils-open-source-wordpress-desktop-application-for-the-mac">unveiled Calypso</a>, a revamped backend interface for WordPress.com.</p>\n<p>Suffice to say, it was a productive year for Automattic and WordPress.com with no signs of slowing down in 2016.

Schroder is joined by newly named deputies, Mel Choyce and Adam Silverstein, who will help manage the release.</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/version-4-5-project-schedule/" target="_blank">4.5 project schedule</a> is now posted. The merge window for feature plugins opens February 3rd and the first Beta is expected the last week of that month. April 12th is the target date for the official release.</p>\n<p>The call for feature plugins is beginning early this time around and a Feature Plugin chat is scheduled for Tuesday, January 12, 2016, 3:00 PM CST.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The main purpose of the early chat is for plugins that believe they are ready for merge, and to start up new ones for future releases,&#8221; Schroder said. Those who have ideas and/or plugins to put forward will have an opportunity to get feedback from other contributors.</p>\n<p>During the kickoff meeting, Schroder took stock of the general areas that contributors have shown interest in working on for WordPress 4.5. Weston Ruter and other contributors on the customizer component have several features in progress, including <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32296" target="_blank">Customize Pane Resizer</a>, <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31195" target="_blank">Customize Device Preview</a>, <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/34893" target="_blank">Customize Setting Validation</a>, and the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/34923" target="_blank">creation of page stubs for adding nav menu items</a>. Ruter considers the Transactions and Selective Refresh features ready to go for consideration in 4.5.</p>\n<p>Michael Arestad said that he is exploring &#8220;a series of smaller projects that can make Post New and the publishing process a bit nicer.&#8221; Joe McGill is hoping to make progress on improving the compression of resized images in core. John Blackbourn expressed interest in working with a team on<br />\n&#8220;No More Mixed Content&#8221; https improvements.</p>\n<p>More detailed discussion about potential feature plugins for 4.5 (and future releases) will happen in the scheduled chat next week.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 07 Jan 2016 05:59:40 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"WPTavern: Briar: A Free Minimalist WordPress Theme Based on Bootstrap";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=50289";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:78:"http://wptavern.com/briar-a-free-minimalist-wordpress-theme-based-on-bootstrap";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3972:"<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/briar/" target="_blank">Briar</a> is a new minimalist theme that landed in the WordPress directory last month. It&#8217;s the type of bold, non-flashy theme that puts the spotlight on content and images without trying to stuff widgets into the reading experience.</p>\n<p>Briar was created by the folks at <a href="http://slicejack.com/" target="_blank">Slicejack</a>, a Croatia-based development company and a brand new WordPress.org theme author. The theme uses the Bootstrap framework to provide a responsive layout for desktop, tablets, and mobile.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/briar-screenshot.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50293"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/briar-screenshot.png?resize=1025%2C769" alt="briar-screenshot" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50293" /></a></p>\n<p>One of Briar&#8217;s most interesting features is the ability for users to create a full-width heading using a shortcode. The content and background image specified in the shortcode will have a parallax effect, which you can see when scrolling on single posts.</p>\n<p>The theme&#8217;s primary menu can be toggled into view using the hamburger icon. It includes support for multi-level navigation.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/multi-level-navigation.gif" rel="attachment wp-att-50316"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/multi-level-navigation.gif?resize=600%2C334" alt="multi-level-navigation" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50316" /></a></p>\n<p>Briar also has a unique fixed footer with post meta that disappears as you scroll down the page. On mobile the post meta is pared down to just the author and post date.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/briar-post.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50299"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/briar-post.png?resize=1025%2C492" alt="briar-post" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50299" /></a></p>\n<p>The theme supports more than a dozen customization options for colors, backgrounds, layouts, and social buttons. Its elegant layout and color selections are some of the nicest customizer controls  I&#8217;ve seen in recently launched themes. The layout controls allow you to select from three different options for the home, blog, single, archive, category archive, search, 404, and default page templates. Briar includes six prepared color schemes as well as 15 different color pickers for customizing individual elements of the theme.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/customizer-layouts.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-50319"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/customizer-layouts.jpg?resize=1025%2C612" alt="customizer-layouts" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50319" /></a></p>\n<p>The theme supports an optional sidebar widget area, which will appear on the templates where you assign a layout with a sidebar. If you&#8217;re using Jetpack, you can enable the infinite scrolling module without having any conflicts.</p>\n<p>Briar&#8217;s design provides excellent readability with contrasting fonts &#8211; Noto sans for headlines and Martel for paragraph text.</p>\n<p>Check out the <a href="http://demo.slicejack.com/briar/" target="_blank">live demo</a> at SliceJack to see the theme in action with the single-column layout.</p>\n<p>Briar is Slicejack&#8217;s first free theme but they have another in the pipeline for approval. The theme is <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/briar/" target="_blank">available on WordPress.org</a> and is also hosted on <a href="https://github.com/themejack/briar" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. If you&#8217;re looking to restart your blog in 2016 with a no-frills, content-focused WordPress theme, Briar fits the bill.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 07 Jan 2016 00:27:44 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:60:"WPTavern: WordPress 4.4.1 Patches XSS Security Vulnerability";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=50297";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-4-1-patches-xss-security-vulnerability";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1415:"<p>WordPress 4.4.1 is <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2016/01/wordpress-4-4-1-security-and-maintenance-release/">available for download</a> and includes 52 fixes, one of which patches a cross site scripting vulnerability <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">reported</a> by <a href="https://hackerone.com/crtc4l">Crtc4L</a>.

Destination after save can also increase performance on large WordPress Multisite installations by reducing page loads, &#8220;If you are paying for web hosting based on usage, reducing the number of page loads in this way could have a real effect on the cost of bandwidth if thousands or millions of users are producing content,&#8221; Whitis told the Tavern.</p>\n<p>One thing I discovered during testing is that content with long titles are cut off because of the drop-down menu location. Other than that, it works as expected on WordPress 4.5 alpha. Whether it&#8217;s creating, editing, or doing repetitive tasks to manage content, destination after save can save you some time.

The attacks are ongoing and the company is struggling to keep its status blog up to notify customers.</p>\n<p>In addition to the DDoS attacks, <a href="http://status.linode.com/incidents/ghdlhfnfngnh" target="_blank">Linode has also confirmed a data security breach</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A security investigation into the unauthorized login of three accounts has led us to the discovery of two Linode.com user credentials on an external machine. This implies user credentials could have been read from our database, either offline or on, at some point. The user table contains usernames, email addresses, securely hashed passwords and encrypted two-factor seeds. The resetting of your password will invalidate the old credentials.</p></blockquote>\n<p>All Linode Manager passwords have been expired as a precaution after customer credentials were found in the wild. The team is working around the clock to mitigate the DDoS attacks and further investigate the unauthorized access to customer accounts. Linode has not yet determined whether there is a link between the two attacks.</p>\n<p>Several days ago, WP Engine <a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-engine-identifies-cloud-infrastructure-providers-as-entry-point-for-recent-security-breach" target="_blank">identified its cloud infrastructure provider as the entry point for the company&#8217;s recent security breach</a>. The company is listed as one of Linode&#8217;s customers. Jason Cohen, the company&#8217;s founder and CTO, jumped in to answer several <a href="http://wptavern.com/wp-engine-identifies-cloud-infrastructure-providers-as-entry-point-for-recent-security-breach#comments" target="_blank">questions in WP Tavern comments</a> earlier today but would neither confirm nor deny that Linode is the cloud infrastructure provider in question.</p>\n<p>PagerDuty, a former Linode customer and <a href="https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/july-2015-security-announcement/" target="_blank">victim of a similar attack</a>, speculates that <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10845985" target="_blank">Linode may have been compromised since July 2015</a> and is only now announcing it:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We immediately reached out to them not only to inform them of their compromise, but to assist them in investigating it. We were confident that the Linode database had been breached, and that the secret key used to encrypt information in the database had been compromised as well.</p>\n<p>In addition to reaching out to Linode, we also worked with a third-party security firm to audit our work done during the incident. Likewise, around the same time we reached out to law enforcement to assist in investigating the attack. We did not get confirmation in July that there was a breach of the Linode Manager or any associated credentials.</p></blockquote>\n<p>PagerDuty migrated away from Linode in August because of this breach, but the company was not allowed to disclose to its customers that Linode was the point of entry.</p>\n<p>WP Engine&#8217;s security breach is strikingly similar, as the company&#8217;s attacker bypassed multiple layers of authentication to gain access to an administrative panel. According to Cohen, &#8220;the criminal’s behavior in this exposure matches a pattern seen in other attacks throughout 2015.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If multiple Linode customers have been affected and are unable to reveal the point of entry, they may have put pressure on the cloud hosting provider to finally publicly disclose the nature of the attack.</p>\n<p>In an age when nearly every hosting provider will have attacks and service disruptions, what matters is how they handle it and communicate with their customers. Linode has been plagued by <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/03/bitcoins-worth-228000-stolen-from-customers-of-hacked-webhost/">multiple</a> <a href="https://blog.linode.com/2013/04/16/security-incident-update/" target="_blank">security</a> <a href="https://blog.linode.com/2014/01/19/an-old-system-and-a-swat-team/" target="_blank">issues</a> in the past. Failure to disclose incidents in a timely way can be costly, especially in the current competitive hosting market where transparency with customers is at a premium.</p>\n<p>When Linode&#8217;s investigation of the criminal activity is complete, it would be appropriate for them to disclose how long they knew about this compromise and when they first acted on it.

In 2015, the team <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2016/01/04/happy-new-year-thank-you/" target="_blank">reviewed and approved 910 new themes</a> with the help of 236 reviewers, according to TRT member Ulrich Pogson.</p>\n<p>Despite their best efforts, the team cannot keep up with the massive influx of themes. The queue has been bogged down by submissions from authors whose themes have not been run against <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Unit_Test" target="_blank">Theme Unit Test Data</a> and the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/" target="_blank">Theme Check Plugin</a>.</p>\n<p>At the end of 2015, some <a href="http://wptavern.com/why-some-theme-authors-are-waiting-two-months-or-more-for-their-first-review" target="_blank">theme authors were waiting two or more months</a> before their first review. One of the reasons, according to TRT member Justin Tadlock, is that many of the themes submitted are far from ready to be approved upon their initial review.</p>\n<p>“The majority of themes submitted don’t follow the guidelines, which considerably slows down the process,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;Themes will often have 20-30 issues or more. If we can get to a point where the majority of submissions only have a few minor issues, we really wouldn’t have a queue.”</p>\n<h3>Automation is Coming Soon</h3>\n<p>The Theme Review Team made a number of controversial decisions at the beginning of 2015, including the move to <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-now-requires-theme-authors-to-use-the-customizer-to-build-theme-options" target="_blank">require theme authors to use the customizer for building theme options</a>. Negative pushback from the community came to a head when the team started cracking down on <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-review-team-is-cracking-down-on-violations-of-the-presentation-vs-functionality-guideline" target="_blank">violations of the presentation vs. functionality guideline</a>.</p>\n<p>At the end of May, Matt Mullenweg joined in on the Theme Review Team&#8217;s slack channel and challenged them to look at the review process and directory in a new way, opening up new avenues for the team to pursue in <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-review-team-seeks-feedback-on-the-review-process-themes-and-the-directory" target="_blank">improving that experience</a>. This was a watershed moment for the Theme Review Team that resulted in the unanimous approval of <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-review-team-unanimously-approves-roadmap-to-improve-directory-and-review-process" target="_blank">a new roadmap to improve the directory and review process</a>.</p>\n<p>The team is now <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/10/07/automation-here-we-come/" target="_blank">moving towards more automation</a>, the first item on the roadmap, starting with auto-approval of theme updates. Automation will make a major impact on the time themes spend in the queue. The team has yet to implement it fully, because they&#8217;re still putting the code in place to improve the system.</p>\n<h3>2015 Theme Review Team Milestones</h3>\n<p>Despite delays on the roadmap, the Theme Review Team implemented many excellent changes during 2015, especially pertaining to education and documentation. In February, the team <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-review-handbook-updated-to-include-design-recommendations" target="_blank">updated the Theme Review Handbook to include design recommendations</a>. These recommendations were created to encourage design feedback on submissions to the directory and are formatted to help the theme author think more critically about design decisions.</p>\n<p>Following the new requirement for WordPress.org themes to use the customizer for creating options, the TRT rallied, putting together more customizer resources and documentation. Nick Halsey assisted the team by updating the Theme Developer Handbook with <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-developer-handbook-updated-with-comprehensive-guide-to-the-customizer-api" target="_blank">a comprehensive guide to the customizer API</a>. The team also began <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-review-team-launches-code-examples-library-on-github" target="_blank">curating a library of code examples on GitHub for theme developers</a>, with the first section devoted to customizer code.</p>\n<p>When WordPress 4.3 added the site icons feature, the Theme Review Team began working with authors to <a href="http://wptavern.com/theme-review-team-begins-phasing-out-favicon-support" target="_blank">phase out favicon support</a> in themes. By the time WordPress 4.5 rolls around, all themes hosted in the official directory should be on track to use the core-supported method of adding site icons.</p>\n<p>In July, the team <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-review-team-votes-to-allow-themes-to-use-the-rest-api-plugin" target="_blank">voted to allow themes to use the WP REST API plugin</a>, officially welcoming these new types of themes into the directory.</p>\n<p>Throughout 2015, the Theme Review team moved quickly to navigate new waters as WordPress core improved. All of these initiatives and resources were created in addition to the 910 new themes that were reviewed and added to the directory. This is remarkable, given that the team is primarily made up of volunteers.</p>\n<p>With the improved tools coming in 2016, WordPress.org theme authors can expect faster reviews, freeing up more time for reviewers to focus on improving the directory, creating more educational resources, and mentoring new reviewers.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 06 Jan 2016 00:28:50 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"WPTavern: 63% of WordPress Core Committers Are Not Employed by Automattic";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=50208";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:99:"http://wptavern.com/sixty-three-percent-of-wordpress-core-committers-are-not-employed-by-automattic";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4262:"<p>In 2014, we <a href="http://wptavern.com/trend-more-people-getting-commit-access-to-the-core-of-wordpress">wrote about the trend</a> of more people receiving commit access to WordPress core. Fast forward to the beginning of 2016 and a total of 35 people can commit code to the core of WordPress. Helen Hou-Sandí, WordPress Lead Developer, <a href="https://twitter.com/helenhousandi/status/682240497528750080">published the stat</a> on Twitter and notes that 22 out of the 35 committers are not employed by Automattic.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Of the 35 WP core committers, 22 do not work for Automattic.

It&#8217;s an enormous responsibility and a recognition of trust, quality, and activity.</p>\n<p>In WordPress&#8217; early years, the number of people with commit access consisted of just a handful of people. In 2010, Matt Mullenweg, Co-Founder of the WordPress project, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2010/01/12/dd32-whatcha-gonna-do/">started the process</a> of expanding that number, &#8220;One of the goals for the team in 2010 is to greatly expand the number of people with direct commit access, so the emphasis is more on review and collaboration,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>There are a myriad of titles given to people involved in the WordPress project. Here are the main titles used to describe those contributing to core.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Release Lead is a temporary title given to those who are leading a WordPress release cycle.</li>\n<li>Lead Developers are those who influence the project&#8217;s direction and are highly involved in the decision-making process.</li>\n<li>Core Developers are permanent committers.</li>\n<li>Contributing Developers are guest committers, feature plugin lead developers, and other contributors highlighted by the release lead.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to increasing the number of people with commit access, it&#8217;s important to recognize the employment of those individuals. In WordPress&#8217; early days, some people were concerned that too many Automattic employees with commit access meant that the company owned and controlled the project. WordPress development only served the commercial interests of Automattic.</p>\n<p>Hou-Sandí&#8217;s statistic that 22 out of the 35 core committers are not employed by Automattic is proof that this isn&#8217;t the case. It also disproves the theory that Automattic owns and controls WordPress. To say that <strong>Automattic is WordPress</strong> is false and a slap in the face to the countless number of people who contribute to the project.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to be part of the awesome statistics shared above, check out <a href="https://nacin.com/2014/02/07/how-wordpress-chooses-committers/">Nacin&#8217;s post</a> on the qualities of a great WordPress contributor.

Ptah Dunbar is stepping up as the lead organizer for the event, which is expected to draw more than 700 attendees.</p>\n<p>BuddyCamp Miami will kick off the event on the 19th, led by John James Jacoby who will be sharing on the current state of BuddyPress.</p>\n<p>“Last year I think organizers and speakers were impressed with the developer-related talks and how many people were learning first-hand what BuddyPress can do.” organizer David Bisset said. “This year we are hoping to do that plus explore how others are using BuddyPress (in building websites and plugins) beyond the obvious ways it can be used.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordCamp Miami will also host its usual Beginner&#8217;s workshop and will continue its How-To track, which received positive reviews last year. Speakers will continue the camp&#8217;s new tradition of going directly to the Happiness Bar to answer questions after their talks.</p>\n<h3>New “Learn JavaScript Deeply” Track</h3>\n<p>In response to Matt Mullenweg urging developers to learn JavaScript, WordCamp Miami will be hosting its first “Learn JavaScript Deeply” track for attendees on Sunday, February 21st.</p>\n<p>“The track is very much setup as an almost full day workshop with a great local developer Michael Schofield hosting,&#8221; Bisset said. &#8220;As it’s planned now, the day starts off with several speakers introducing the required tools for working with JavaScript and WordPress. From there we explore the more advanced aspects of JavaScript while touching on frameworks such as BackBone, AngularJS, and React.”</p>\n<p>WordPress developers Josh Pollock, Camden Segal, and Kevin Stover will be presenting along with local and surprise speakers. Attendees will receive resources after the event that they can use to continue learning and writing code.</p>\n<h3>New Freelancer’s Workshop</h3>\n<p>In 2015, WordCamp Miami hosted a general workshop day for more than 300 attendees. This year the conference will host a <a href="https://2016.miami.wordcamp.org/2016/01/03/announcing-our-freelance-workshop-february-19th/" target="_blank">Freelancer&#8217;s Workshop</a> on February 19th.</p>\n<p>“We have so many freelancers (or people wishing to jump into freelancing) in South Florida, it seemed like a no-brainer once we clearly saw that the number of speaker submissions would support such a workshop,” organizer David Bisset said.</p>\n<p>The workshop will cover subjects like pricing strategies, branding yourself as a freelancer, and client relations. Keeping freelancer topics in a separate workshop allows WordCamp Miami&#8217;s business track (held on Sunday, February 21st), to be more focused towards businesses and less on individual freelancers.</p>\n<h3>WordPress Users: The Next Generation</h3>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/kids-blogging-feature.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-23102"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/kids-blogging-feature.jpg?resize=1025%2C490" alt="kids-blogging-feature" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23102" /></a></p>\n<p>WordCamp Miami will be hosting its first kids&#8217; panel, “The Next Generation of WordPress Users,&#8221; on Sunday, February 21st. Organizers are actively looking for children under 18 who use WordPress and/or those who blog on other platforms. The panel will showcase how young people are using WordPress, what they think about blogging, and what other technologies they are using for publishing.</p>\n<p>“Miami has always been youth-friendly but we thought a panel would be a good way to bring more young ones into the weekend schedule so that WordPress developers and leaders get to hear the childrens&#8217; viewpoints and thoughts &#8211; what tools they are using &#8211; why they are using them, etc,&#8221; Bisset said. &#8220;The newest generation will soon be the ones creating the new WordPress themes or plugins (or perhaps building something totally unique).

This incident prompted an investigation, which is now complete.</p>\n<p>According to the most recent and <a href="https://wpengine.com/support/infosec/" target="_blank">final update</a>, investigators determined that the security exposure came through one of the host&#8217;s cloud infrastructure providers. Customer credentials were exposed on December 4th and detected by WP Engine on December 9th. At that point customers were notified, the investigation was launched, and customer credentials were reset as a security precaution.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WP Engine was attacked by an external criminal whose point of entry came through one of our cloud infrastructure providers,&#8221; founder and CTO Jason Cohen told the Tavern.</p>\n<p>&#8220;An investigation by our own security team and independent security experts revealed the attacker bypassed multiple layers of authentication and gained unauthorized access to an administrative panel provided by this infrastructure provider. The criminal&#8217;s behavior in this exposure matches a pattern seen in other attacks throughout 2015,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>When news of the breach was first published customers expressed frustration about the host’s lack of two-factor authentication. However, Cohen said that 2FA would not have made an impact for those affected by the recent security breach.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Because the point of entry wasn&#8217;t one of our systems, 2FA would not have prevented this event,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That said, 2FA is a best-practice, and so we do have plans to roll out 2FA in our User Portal in early 2016.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We also recommend that our customers enable 2FA for their WordPress site using one of the following recommended plugins: Google Authenticator or Clef, or use an external authentication system such as Google OAuth,&#8221; Cohen said.</p>\n<p>WP Engine contacted the companies that were directly impacted by the attacker and implemented a plan to ensure their security. The independent investigation is now complete, but WP Engine continues to work with law enforcement authorities who are conducting a criminal investigation.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 04 Jan 2016 22:24:40 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:74:"WPTavern: Git for WordPress Developers: A Free Video Course from WP Pusher";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=50150";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:83:"http://wptavern.com/git-for-wordpress-developers-a-free-video-course-from-wp-pusher";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4290:"<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/git-4-wp.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50165"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/git-4-wp.png?resize=1025%2C510" alt="git-4-wp" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50165" /></a></p>\n<p>Peter Suhm, creator of <a href="https://wppusher.com/" target="_blank">WP Pusher</a>, just released a new free video course for WordPress developers. After the success of his email-based <a href="https://wppusher.com/wordpress-git-crash-course" target="_blank">WP Git Crash Course</a>, Suhm jumped head-first into creating more educational material in video format. <a href="https://git4wp.com/" target="_blank">Git4wp.com</a> launched this week with more than 1.5 hours of recorded lessons, split up into 35 videos.</p>\n<p>The new course offers a comprehensive look at commands, workflows, and anything a WordPress developer would need to know about using GitHub. Suhm&#8217;s teaser for the course is a 5-minute screencast demonstrating how to contribute to an open source WordPress plugin on GitHub.</p>\n<p><span class="embed-youtube"></span></p>\n<p>More Git-proficient WordPress developers means more potential customers for Suhm&#8217;s WP Pusher product, which allows you to deploy WordPress themes and plugins from GitHub.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The videos are a great way for me to educate developers who might be interested in WP Pusher, so we can be more on the same page,&#8221; Suhm said. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of jargon in the world of Git.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition to the new video format, he opted to take a beginner-friendly approach with bite-sized tutorials for all skill levels.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The email course I made last summer was very well received and the number one piece of feedback was to create a similar thing in video format,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The email course was very much chronological, mostly showing my own workflow. With the videos I wanted to make something that was more for everyone &#8211; from beginners to developers already using Git. I think there will be a video for everyone, even more advanced Git users.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The course begins with videos explaining what Git is and why you might want to use it, the difference between Git and Subversion, and covers the most commonly-used Git commands. The following videos include a breakdown of more advanced commands like <code>git bisect</code> and <code>git rebase</code>.</p>\n<p>With more WordPress-related projects moving to GitHub, Suhm thought that it was a good time to create a video resource to help developers get on board. He underestimated the effort it would require until after he had already jumped headlong into creating <a href="https://git4wp.com" target="_blank">Git4wp.com</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Honestly, when I started recording the videos, I didn&#8217;t realize the amount of work I was in for,&#8221; Suhm told the Tavern. &#8220;Since I&#8217;ve been using Git professionally on a daily basis for a good amount of time, I thought I could just hit record and start talking. Recording and especially editing the videos ended up taking way more time than I thought initially.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Screencasts are something I&#8217;ve wanted to try for a while. I&#8217;m not a native English speaker, so it&#8217;s also been a personal challenge releasing the videos,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Suhm plans to keep updating the videos and will add more as time permits. He is committed to keeping the course free as an educational resource for WordPress developers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t need to make money from the videos, since they are in a sense subsidized by my product WP Pusher,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s much like when a company contributes to open source, which they can only afford if they have income coming from somewhere else.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The last set of videos include an overview of how to contribute to GitHub-hosted open source projects as well as tips for incorporating WP Pusher into your workflow. <a href="https://wppusher.com/" target="_blank">WP Pusher</a> is 100% free for open source projects that are hosted in a public repository, so students of the course can easily follow along and practice with their own projects.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 04 Jan 2016 17:29:23 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"Matt: Dorm Room Tycoon Podcast";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=45726";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:47:"https://ma.tt/2016/01/dorm-room-tycoon-podcast/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:133:"<p>I joined an episode of the Dorm Room Tycoon podcast, <a href="http://drt.fm/matt-mullenweg/">which you can check out here</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 02 Jan 2016 18:56:18 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 219 – The 2015 Year in Review Part 2 of 2";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"http://wptavern.com?p=50137&preview_id=50137";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:76:"http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-219-the-2015-year-in-review-part-2-of-2";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1226:"<p>In this episode of WordPress Weekly, <a href="http://marcuscouch.com/">Marcus Couch</a> and I wrap up our year in review.

This feature is known as &#8220;Shiny Updates&#8221;. I&#8217;m a big fan of this feature because it&#8217;s substantially quicker than updating plugins via the updates page. Here&#8217;s what it looks like in action.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/NewPluginUpdateRoutine.gif" rel="attachment wp-att-41064"><img class="size-full wp-image-41064" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/NewPluginUpdateRoutine.gif?resize=837%2C688" alt="New Plugin Update Routine" /></a>New Plugin Update Routine\n<p>Due to complications near the end of the 4.2 development cycle, <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31529">shiny updates for themes</a> was pushed back to a later release. Since WordPress 4.3 and 4.4 didn&#8217;t add shiny update support for themes, I reached out to <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/obenland">Konstantin Obenland</a>, WordPress core developer, to find out its progress.</p>\n<h2>Experimental Plugin</h2>\n<p>The feature is currently on hold as the development team figures out the best way to implement it. The team is experimenting with different approaches <a href="https://github.com/obenland/shiny-updates">using a feature plugin</a>. When installed, updates can be quickly applied from a theme&#8217;s detailed information panel by clicking the update now link.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ExperimentalThemeShinyUpdates.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50116"><img class="size-full wp-image-50116" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ExperimentalThemeShinyUpdates.png?resize=474%2C236" alt="Shiny Update Support Added" /></a>Shiny Update Support Added\n<p>Not a lot of people know about the plugin because it was created around the time of WordCamp US. &#8220;Most of the things that are in the plugin are just quick ideas, a first iteration to get us going. We haven’t performed any user testing nor have we had a proper design iteration yet,&#8221; Obenland told the Tavern.</p>\n<h2>My Experience With Shiny Theme Updates</h2>\n<p>When I&#8217;m browsing themes that I&#8217;ve installed on my site, they&#8217;re displayed in a card format. When a theme has an update available, the update text displays at the top of the card. I tried to click on the text thinking it would update the theme but instead, it opened the theme&#8217;s details panel.</p>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ThemeCardUpdateNotification.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50117"><img class="size-full wp-image-50117" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ThemeCardUpdateNotification.png?resize=384%2C307" alt="Theme Card Update Notification " /></a>Theme Card Update Notification\n<p>In the same way I can update plugins on the plugins page, I should be able to update themes on the themes page. Having the shiny update link in the details pane requires an unnecessary mouse click. There are at least two challenges to overcome. The first is rewording the Update Available text to something that serves as both a notification and a link to initiate the update. The second is determining whether it&#8217;s an improved user experience.</p>\n<h2>Why Shiny Updates Are so Fast</h2>\n<p>Since shiny updates were added for plugins, I&#8217;ve been curious as to why they&#8217;re so much quicker than the normal update process. According to Oblenland, shiny updates are quicker because, &#8220;We don’t need to reload the entire admin page, twice if you include navigating back to the plugin screen. We only send the update request itself and receive the result of that. So instead of 85 requests over two page loads when deleting a plugin, we only have one,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<h2>How You Can Get Involved</h2>\n<p>Although the development team is not sure which direction they&#8217;ll go with shiny updates, Obenland says they want to use it to unite various actions in WordPress, &#8220;We want to unify the flows of installing/updating/activating/deleting plugins/themes/core with it and ultimately be able to get rid of the bleak screen of sadness that users currently see when performing these actions,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Shiny updates is a feature plugin not tied to a specific trac ticket. If you want to keep up with development, you can <a href="https://github.com/obenland/shiny-updates">follow the project</a> on GitHub.  You can also follow <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">discussions on Slack</a> in the <strong>#feature-shinyupdates</strong> channel. Obenland notes that the team is looking for more people who want to help develop, test the plugin, and share feedback at their weekly meetings on Tuesdays at 1900 UTC.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 29 Dec 2015 23:16:08 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:49:"WPTavern: Add Telegram to Jetpack Sharing Buttons";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=49931";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"http://wptavern.com/add-telegram-to-jetpack-sharing-buttons";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4042:"<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/telegram.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50107"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/telegram.png?resize=1025%2C469" alt="telegram" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50107" /></a></p>\n<p>On December 17, telecommunications companies <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/brazil-whatsapp-ban-idINKBN0U00CT20151217" target="_blank">cut off access to WhatsApp in Brazil</a> after the company did not comply with police wiretapping requests. Many of the app&#8217;s estimated 100 million users went in search of an alternative, landing on <a href="https://telegram.org/" target="_blank">Telegram</a>, WhatsApp&#8217;s rival messaging app. Telegram  <a href="https://twitter.com/telegram/status/677604437905580032" target="_blank">gained 5.7 million new users</a> in one day as a result of the 48-hr blackout.</p>\n<p>Incidents like this offer Telegram an opportunity to chip away at WhatsApp&#8217;s dominant marketshare. As of May 2015, the app reported <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/05/13/telegram-says-its-hit-62-maus-and-messaging-activity-has-doubled/?ncid=rss" target="_blank">62 million monthly active users</a>.

The plugin was created by Brazilian WordPress developer <a href="http://valeriosouza.com.br/" target="_blank">Valerio Souza</a>, who is also the the author of the <a href="http://wptavern.com/new-plugin-adds-a-whatsapp-button-to-jetpacks-sharing-module" target="_blank">WhatsApp Sharing Button for Jetpack</a>.</p>\n<p>After activating the plugin, if you&#8217;re already using Jetpack&#8217;s sharing module, you can visit the settings page to drag the Telegram icon into the enabled services section. The new Telegram sharing button will not appear on the desktop version of your site. You will need to test it by visiting a post from a mobile device.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/telegram-sharing.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50086"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/telegram-sharing.png?resize=1025%2C515" alt="telegram-sharing" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50086" /></a></p>\n<p>The only complaint I have is that the white circle around the icon makes it look somewhat out of place among the other icons that share a simpler design. The icon&#8217;s resolution also needs to be improved for retina displays. Other than that, everything looks and works as advertised when sharing a post to Telegram.</p>\n<p>If you haven&#8217;t recently taken inventory of your Jetpack sharing buttons, you may want to review your most popular content to see what services readers are using to share your posts. Depending on the demographics of your site&#8217;s visitors, both the WhatsApp and Telegram sharing buttons may be more beneficial than the &#8220;Email,&#8221; &#8220;Google+,&#8221; or &#8220;Print&#8221; buttons, for example. These could be hidden behind the share button. As groups and channels become more common on mobile messaging apps, prominently displaying sharing buttons for these services may help your posts travel faster and further than any kind of search engine optimization.</p>\n<p>Both the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/telegram-sharing-button-for-jetpack/" target="_blank">Telegram</a> and <a href="http://wptavern.com/new-plugin-adds-a-whatsapp-button-to-jetpacks-sharing-module" target="_blank">WhatsApp</a> Sharing buttons for Jetpack can be downloaded for free from the WordPress.org plugin directory.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 29 Dec 2015 20:53:41 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:83:"WPTavern: Automattic’s WordAds Network is Now Open to Self-Hosted WordPress Sites";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=50053";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:90:"http://wptavern.com/automattics-wordads-network-is-now-open-to-self-hosted-wordpress-sites";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3909:"<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AdControl.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50071"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/AdControl.png?resize=1025%2C481" alt="AdControl" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50071" /></a></p>\n<p>Automattic <a href="https://wordads.co/2015/12/28/adcontrol-plugin-is-here/" target="_blank">announced</a> today that its <a href="https://wordads.co/" target="_blank">WordAds</a> advertising network is now available to self-hosted WordPress sites via Jetpack and the new <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/radcontrol/" target="_blank">AdControl</a> plugin. WordAds, which bears a name confusingly similar to Google&#8217;s <a href="https://www.google.com/adwords/" target="_blank">AdWords</a>, delivers all the advertising seen on WordPress.com&#8217;s free sites. (Ad display on VIP or upgraded sites is opt-in.)</p>\n<p>Self-hosted WordPress site owners who want to earn money with WordAds must first <a href="https://wordads.co/signup/" target="_blank">apply</a> to join the network and are required to meet a minimum traffic requirement. Automattic doesn&#8217;t publish the exact minimum necessary for eligibility but the <a href="https://wordads.co/faq/" target="_blank">WordAds FAQ</a> page says &#8220;a site generally needs thousands of page views each month.&#8221; The site will also need to have both Jetpack and the AdControl plugin installed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been working on the plugin off and on (mostly off) since mid 2014,&#8221; said Derek Springer, a Code Wrangler at Automattic who helped write the AdControl plugin. &#8220;We took a big pause to completely re-work the back end (WordAds 2.0) which is what we are now using all over WordPress.com.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href="https://wordads.co/2015/11/02/introducing-wordads-2-0/" target="_blank">WordAds 2.0</a>, unveiled in November 2015, integrated WordAds into WordPress.com’s main Settings interface with earnings reports and payout information. It also introduced a real time bidding environment where ad agencies and buyers can bid on global ad impressions.</p>\n<p>In 2013, Automattic paid out around $1 million to WordAds publishers whose sites delivered 1 billion ad impressions per month. Published numbers are not yet available for 2015, but WordAds 2.0 has increased interest in the program, according to the <a href="https://wordads.co/2015/12/28/adcontrol-plugin-is-here/" target="_blank">announcement</a> today. With the release of AdControl for self-hosted sites, the number of publishers available on the network has the potential to increase significantly.</p>\n<h3>Why Does AdControl Require Jetpack?</h3>\n<p>For years, the WordPress community has been <a href="http://wptavern.com/how-important-is-jetpack-on-wordpress-road-to-50-market-share" target="_blank">waiting to see how Automattic will monetize Jetpack</a>. In addition to giving self-hosted users access to many of WordPress.com&#8217;s features, Jetpack now serves as a gateway to Automattic&#8217;s advertising network for more than 1 million active installs.</p>\n<p>I asked Springer why AdControl requires Jetpack and he cited the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We need the site’s unique ID (assigned to each Jetpack site) to track ad impressions in the back-end.</li>\n<li>We piggyback on Jetpack’s REST API connection to access some authenticated endpoints in the WP.com API.</li>\n<li>The payout/earning settings are all controlled via Calypso and we want a singular, unified experience.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>WordAds is deeply tied into WordPress.com&#8217;s infrastructure and as such requires authentication for tracking and rewarding participating sites. Jetpack provides the connecting link and is now key to opening up the world of independently-hosted WordPress blogs to Automattic&#8217;s advertising network.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 29 Dec 2015 06:27:08 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:10:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Wed, 20 Jan 2016 04:31:02 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:8:"text/xml";s:14:"content-length";s:6:"207114";s:10:"connection";s:5:"close";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Wed, 20 Jan 2016 04:15:14 GMT";s:15:"x-frame-options";s:10:"SAMEORIGIN";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT lax 250";s:13:"accept-ranges";s:5:"bytes";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20130910210210";}', 'no');

SCM subsequently acquired 100% share of SCTV over a period of time between November 2001 and April 2002, and went public in July 2002.\r\n<p class="text-right"><a href="history">read more</a></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<h2>Business Strategy</h2>\r\nIn order to make our vision become reality, along with it''s mission accomplishment, our business strategies are as follows :\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>To continuously enhance our team''s development and productivity, PT.
